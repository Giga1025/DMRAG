You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Project Context:
- Building an AI Dungeon Master application for D&D
- Focus on chat interfaces, game state management, and AI integration
- Prioritize clean, modular code structure

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., isGameActive, hasPlayerTurn)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

UI and Styling:
- Use Tailwind for all styling with mobile-first approach
- Create reusable components for chat, game state, and player management
- Implement responsive design for both desktop and mobile D&D sessions

Performance Optimization:
- Minimize 'use client' usage; favor React Server Components
- Use dynamic loading for AI model components
- Optimize for real-time chat performance
