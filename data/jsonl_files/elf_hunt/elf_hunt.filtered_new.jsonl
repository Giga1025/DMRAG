The treant should interfere before any harm is done and inform the party that they shouldn’t hurt the Feywild. If the players persist, then they may end up in a deadly fight against this guardian that wouldotherwise make sure the players’ journey remains safe.\nScene 7: The Labyrinth After travelling for a long time through the Feywild, the party will eventually reach the labyrinth where Imis is hiding. Unfortunately, she’s hired some defense in case she was ever tracked or disturbed.\nYour journey through the Feywild brings you out of the forest where you suddenly stand before a wall of fog. The fog is clearly magical and as you stand and look at it, itdisperses to reveal a hedge maze. The fog blocks your sight to the sides so you have no idea how large this maze is, but the entrance is right before you. This must be Imis’ domain.\nThe journey through the maze is both easy and hard.There are no maps because maps are not necessary inthis scene. The maze is set in the Feywild, which plays tricks on the players’ memories, so they won’t be ableto map the maze"}

It was playtested in 2016 by a group of players who took turns being the dungeonmaster. This group of“gamemasters” started out when my wife saw a notice about someone looking for a group for D&D in a nearbycommunity. We had a newborn daughter at the time, sowe posted that we would be interested in playing under certain conditions to ensure that our daughter always came first. We assembled a group and one of the conditions was that the games were always played at our place so that our daughter could remain in a safe environment. Another requirement was that she came first, so whenever she wasn’t asleep, was hungry, needed to be changed, etc, then one of us would focus on that instead of playing D&D. The final criteria was that we ended our sessions latest at 21:00 since she was then put to sleep and we wanted to avoid the loud noises from excited D&D players to wake her up. The project evolved into each player taking turns being the dungeonmaster and as I write this epilogue we stillhaven’t gone through each player yet.\nThis adventure is the adventure I wrote for when it was my turn to be the dungeonmaster, and it was greatly inspired by the adventure that my wife wrote.
