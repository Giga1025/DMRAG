<H1>Playing the Game </H1>

<Sect>
<H2>Rhythm of Play </H2>

<P>The three main pillars of D&amp;D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern: </P>

<P>1: The Game Master Describes a Scene. The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, and so on). </P>

<P>2: The Players Describe What Their Characters Do. Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns. </P>

<P>3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’ Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1. </P>

<P>This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&amp;D), whether the </P>

<Sect>
<H6>EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES </H6>

<P>General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise. </P>

<P>The game also includes elements—class features, </P>

<P>feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, mon</P>

<P>ster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contra</P>

<P>dict a general rule. When an exception and a general </P>

<P>rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a </P>

<P>feature says you can make melee attacks using your </P>

<P>Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement </P>

<P>disagrees with the general rule. </P>

<P>adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and </P>

<P>everyone takes turns. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Six Abilities </H2>

<P>All creatures—characters and monsters—have six </P>

<P>abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table. </P>

<P>Ability Descriptions Ability Score Measures … </P>

<P>Strength Physical might </P>

<P>Dexterity Agility, reflexes, and balance </P>

<P>Constitution Health and stamina </P>

<P>Intelligence Reasoning and memory </P>

<P>Wisdom Perceptiveness and mental fortitude </P>

<P>Charisma Confidence, poise, and charm </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Ability Scores </H3>

<P>Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Ability Scores Score Meaning </H5>

<P>1 This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. </P>

<P>2–9 This represents a weak capability. </P>

<P>10–11 This represents the human average. </P>

<P>12–19 This represents a strong capability. </P>

<P>20 This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise. </P>

<P>21–29 This represents an extraordinary capability. </P>

<P>30 This is the highest a score can go. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Ability Modifiers </H3>

<P>Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever </P>

<P>you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in </P>

<P>“D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table. </P>

<P>ROUND DOWN </P>

<P>Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up. </P>

<P>Ability Modifiers Score Modifier Score Modifier </P>

<P>1 −5 16–17 +3 2–3 −4 18–19 +4 4–5 −3 20–21 +5 6–7 −2 22–23 +6 8–9 −1 24–25 +7 </P>

<P>10–11 +0 26–27 +8 12–13 +1 28–29 +9 14–15 +2 30 +10 </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>D20 Tests </H2>

<P>When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps: </P>

<P>4: Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s, </P>

<P>but you use the number from only one of them— </P>

<P>the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage. </P>

<P>5: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num</P>

<P>ber rolled on the d20: </P>

<P>• The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability </P>

<P>modifiers to use for various D20 Tests. </P>

<P>• Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each crea</P>

<P>ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added </P>

<P>when making a D20 Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has pro</P>

<P>ficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the </P>

<P>Game.” </P>

<P>• Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll. </P>

<P>6: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules Glossary”). </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Ability Checks </H3>

<P>An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Ability Modifier </H4>

<P>An ability check is named for the ability modifier it </P>

<P>uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check’s use. </P>

<P>Ability Check Examples Ability Make a Check To … </P>

<P>Strength Lift, push, pull, or break something </P>

<P>Dexterity Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly </P>

<P>Constitution Push your body beyond normal limits </P>

<P>Intelligence Reason or remember </P>

<P>Wisdom Notice things in the environment or in creatures’ behavior </P>

<P>Charisma Influence, entertain, or deceive </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Proficiency Bonus </H4>

<P>Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check </P>

<P>when the GM determines that a skill or tool pro</P>

<P>ficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a </P>

<P>Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can </P>

<P>add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more information about skill and tool proficiencies. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Difficulty Class </H4>

<P>The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task, </P>

<P>the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks. </P>

<H3>Saving Throws </H3>

<P>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery </P>

<P>explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it. </P>

<P>If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Ability Modifier </H4>

<P>Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers </P>

<P>they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on the Saving Throw Examples table. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Saving Throw Examples </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Ability Make a Save To … </H5>

<P>Strength Physically resist direct force </P>

<P>Dexterity Dodge out of harm’s way </P>

<P>Constitution Endure a toxic hazard </P>

<P>Intelligence Recognize an illusion as fake </P>

<P>Wisdom Resist a mental assault </P>

<P>Charisma Assert your identity </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Proficiency Bonus </H4>

<P>You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Difficulty Class </H4>

<P>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability </P>

<P>and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call </P>

<P>for saves specify the DC. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Attack Rolls </H3>

<P>An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usually occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery competition. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Ability Modifier </H4>

<P>The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability </P>

<P>modifier to use for different types of attack rolls. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Attack Roll Abilities Ability Attack Type </H5>

<P>Strength Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”) </P>

<P>Dexterity Ranged attack with a weapon </P>

<P>Varies Spell attack (the ability used is determined by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as explained in “Spells”) </P>

<P>Some features let you use different ability modifiers </P>

<P>from those listed. For example, the Finesse property (see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexterity with a weapon that has that property. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Proficiency Bonus </H4>

<P>You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. </P>

<P>See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more information about weapon proficiencies. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Armor Class </H4>

<P>A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC of a character is determined at character creation (see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat block. </P>

<P>Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same base AC calculation: </P>

<P>Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier </P>

<P>A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor, </P>

<P>magic items, spells, and more. </P>

<P>Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features give characters a different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a creature. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Rolling 20 or 1 </H4>

<P>If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any mod</P>

<P>ifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit </P>

<P>(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”). </P>

<P>If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an attack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Advantage/Disadvantage </H3>

<P>Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvan</P>

<P>tage reflects negative circumstances. </P>

<P>You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities and actions. The </P>

<Sect>
<H6>HEROIC INSPIRATION </H6>

<P>Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll. </P>

<P>Only One at a Time. You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a player character in your group who lacks it. </P>

<P>Gaining Heroic Inspiration. Your GM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing. </P>

<P>Other rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration. </P>

<P>GM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Roll Two D20s </H4>

<P>When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>They Don’t Stack </H4>

<P>If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two d20s. </P>

<P>If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Interactions with Rerolls </H4>

<P>When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. You choose which one. </P>

<P>For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one of those dice, not both of them. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Proficiency </H2>

<P>Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All crea</P>

<P>tures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the </P>

<P>impact that training has on the creature’s capabil</P>

<P>ities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as </P>

<P>the character gains levels (described in “Character </P>

<P>Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based </P>

<P>on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The </P>

<P>Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is </P>

<P>determined. This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the crea</P>

<P>ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or </P>

<P>with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells. </P>

<P>Proficiency Bonus Level or CR Bonus Level or CR Bonus </P>

<P>Up to 4 +2 17–20 +6 5–8 +3 21–24 +7 9–12 +4 25–28 +8 13–16 +5 29–30 +9 </P>

<Sect>
<H3>The Bonus Doesn’t Stack </H3>

<P>Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll </P>

<P>or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or </P>

<P>Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills. </P>

<P>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the Expertise feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Skill Proficiencies </H3>

<P>Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation. </P>

<P>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving </P>

<Part>
<H4>Determining Skills </H4>

<P>A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill </P>

<P>proficiencies appear in its stat block. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Saving Throw Proficiencies </H3>

<P>Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your </P>

<P>Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving </P>

<P>throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving </P>

<P>throws, representing that class’s training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, </P>

<P>are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; </P>

<P>they train to resist mental assault. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Equipment Proficiencies </H3>

<P>A character gains proficiency with various weapons </P>

<P>and tools from their class and background. There </P>

<P>are two categories of equipment proficiency: </P>

<P>Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it. </P>

<P>Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check. </P>

<Part>
<Sect>
<H2>Actions </H2>

<P>When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action table lists the game’s main actions, which are de</P>

<P>fined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.” </P>

<P>Actions Action Summary </P>

<H5>Action Summary </H5>

<P>Disengage Your movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn. </P>

<P>Dodge Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. </P>

<P>Help Help another creature’s ability check or </P>

<P>attack roll, or administer first aid. </P>

<P>Hide Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. </P>

<P>Influence Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature’s attitude. </P>

<P>trigger you define. </P>

<P>Search Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check. </P>

<P>Study Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check. </P>

<P>Utilize Use a nonmagical object. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>One Thing at a Time </H3>

<P>The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.” </P>

<P>Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature’s body language, but you can’t do both at the same time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with the Utilize action). </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Bonus Actions </H3>

<P>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don’t have a Bonus Action to take. </P>

<P>You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn, so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you have more than one available. </P>

<P>You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Reactions </H3>

<P>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in “Playing the Game,” is the most common type of Reaction. </P>

<P>When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction. </P>

<P>In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s description says otherwise. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Social Interaction </H2>

<P>During their adventures, player characters meet many different people and face some monsters that </P>

<P>would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s </P>

<P>time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to </P>

<P>confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The </P>

<P>Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer characters who are participating. </P>

<P>An NPC’s attitude toward your character is Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder. </P>

<P>Social interactions progress in two ways: through roleplaying and ability checks. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Roleplaying </H3>

<P>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. </P>

<P>As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an active approach or a descriptive approach. </P>

<P>The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an </P>
</Part>
<Part>
<H3>Ability Checks </H3>

<P>Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In such situations, the GM will typically ask you to </P>

<P>take the Influence action. Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when </P>

<P>thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use an approach that relies on your group’s skill pro</P>

<P>ficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick </P>

<P>a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue </P>

<P>who is proficient in Deception should lead the </P>

<P>discussion. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Exploration </H2>

<P>Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Adventuring Equipment </H3>

<P>As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops. </P>

<P>See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and “Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful. The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff, for example, to push a sinister-looking button that you’re reluctant to touch. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Vision and Light </H3>

<P>Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are </P>

<P>affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Obscured Areas </H4>

<P>An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a </P>

<P>Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have </P>

<P>Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. </P>

<P>A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glossary”) when trying to see something there. </P>

<P>The presence or absence of light determines the cat</P>

<P>egory of illumination in an area, as defined below. </P>

<P>Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. </P>

<P>Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light. </P>

<P>Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Special Senses </H4>

<P>Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glos</P>

<P>sary” defines the following special senses: </P>

<P>Blindsight Darkvision Tremorsense Truesight </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Hiding </H3>

<P>Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Game Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Interacting with Objects </H3>

<P>Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the GM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>What Is an Object? </H4>

<P>For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Time-Limited Object Interactions </H4>

<P>When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Finding Hidden Objects </H4>

<P>When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden </P>

<P>object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, </P>

<P>other important details, or both. </P>

<P>If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Carrying Objects </H4>

<P>You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in “Rules Glossary.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Breaking Objects </H4>

<P>As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the GM might use the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.” </P>

<Sect>
<H6>MARCHING ORDER </H6>

<P>The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to </P>

<P>those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change </P>

<P>your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it. </P>

<H3>Hazards </H3>

<P>Monsters are the main perils characters face, but </P>

<P>other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the </P>

<P>During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The GM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the GM might have you use the travel pace rules below. </P>

<P>If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.” </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Travel Pace </H4>

<P>While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain. </P>

<P>Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below. </P>

<P>Fast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. </P>

<P>Normal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. </P>

<H4>Vehicles </H4>

<P>Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equipment” includes vehicles for sale. </P>

<H2>Combat </H2>

<P>Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>The Order of Combat </H3>

<P>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two </P>

<P>sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, </P>

<P>footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once </P>

<P>everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the </P>

<P>next round if neither side is defeated. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Combat Step by Step </H4>

<P>Combat unfolds in these steps: </P>

<P>1: Establish Positions. The Game Master determines where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other lo</P>

<P>cation, the GM figures out where the adversaries </P>

<P>are—how far away and in what direction. </P>

<P>2: Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns. </P>

<P>3: Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round </P>

<P>ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Initiative </H4>

<P>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative. </P>

<P>Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised. </P>

<P>Initiative Order. A combatant’s check total is called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round. </P>

<P>Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among tied characters. The GM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Your Turn </H4>

<P>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed and take one action. You decide whether to </P>

<P>move first or take your action first. </P>

<P>The main actions you can take are listed in “Actions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s features and a monster’s stat block also provide action options. “Movement and Position” later in “Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement. </P>

<P>Communicating. You can communicate however you are able—through brief utterances and gestures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither </P>

<P>your action nor your move. Extended communication, such as a detailed explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a </P>

<P>foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the main way you try to influence a monster. </P>

<P>Interacting with Things. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe. </P>

<P>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. </P>

<P>PLAYING ON A GRID </P>

<P>If you play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules. </P>

<P>Squares. Each square represents 5 feet. Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in </P>

<P>5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of </P>

<P>30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally </P>

<P>or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain </P>

<P>costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more. Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature </P>

<P>that fills its space. </P>

<P>Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects— count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route. </P>

<P>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM might require you to take the Utilize action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge. </P>

<P>Doing Nothing on Your Turn. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready action to delay acting. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Ending Combat </H4>

<P>Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked </P>

<P>out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also </P>

<P>end when both sides agree to end it. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Movement and Position </H3>

<P>On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move. </P>

<P>Your movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules Glossary”). These different modes of movement can be combined with your regular movement, or they can constitute your entire move. </P>

<P>However you’re moving with your Speed, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from it until it is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first. </P>

<P>A character’s Speed is determined during character creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Difficult Terrain </H4>

<P>Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult </P>

<P>Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult Terrain. </P>

<P>Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs </P>

<P>1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count </P>

<P>as Difficult Terrain. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Breaking Up Your Move </H4>

<P>You can break up your move, using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go 10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Dropping Prone </H4>

<P>On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your Speed is 0. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Creature Size </H4>

<P>A creature belongs to a size category, which determines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size and Space table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s space is the area that it effectively controls in com</P>

<P>bat and the area it needs to fight effectively. </P>

<P>A character’s size is determined by species, and </P>

<P>a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat </P>

<P>block. </P>

<P>Creature Size and Space Size Space (Feet) Space (Squares) </P>

<P>Tiny 2½ by 2½ feet 4 per square </P>

<P>Small 5 by 5 feet 1 square </P>

<P>Medium 5 by 5 feet 1 square </P>

<P>Large 10 by 10 feet 4 squares (2 by 2) </P>

<P>Huge 15 by 15 feet 9 squares (3 by 3) </P>

<P>Gargantuan 20 by 20 feet 16 squares (4 by 4) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Moving around Other Creatures </H4>

<P>During your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you. </P>

<P>Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for </P>

<P>you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally. </P>

<P>You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Making an Attack </H3>

<P>When you take the Attack action, you make an attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions also let you make an attack. Whether you </P>

<P>strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon, </P>

<P>UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS </P>

<P>When you make an attack roll against a target you can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss. </P>

<P>When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage on attack rolls against it. </P>

<P>If you are hidden when you make an attack roll, </P>

<P>you give away your location when the attack hits or </P>

<P>misses. </P>

<P>or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure: </P>

<P>1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location. </P>

<P>2: Determine Modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has Cover (see the next section) and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. </P>

<P>3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Cover </H3>

<P>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro</P>

<P>vide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. </P>

<P>As detailed in the Cover table, there are three degrees of cover, each of which gives a different bene</P>

<P>fit to a target. </P>

<P>A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover. </P>

<H3>Ranged Attacks </H3>

<P>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow, </P>

<P>hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Range </H4>

<P>You can make ranged attacks only against targets </P>

<P>within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as </P>

<P>one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range. </P>

<P>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond long range. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat </H4>

<P>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe </P>

<P>is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5 feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”). </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Melee Attacks </H3>

<P>A melee attack allows you to attack a target within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Reach </H4>

<P>A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack. Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Opportunity Attacks </H4>

<P>Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard. If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack. </P>

<P>Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are moved without using your movement, action, Bonus Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy. </P>

<P>Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack occurs right before it leaves your reach. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Mounted Combat </H3>

<P>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Mounting and Dismounting </H4>

<P>During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Controlling a Mount </H4>

<P>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training. </P>

<P>The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. </P>

<P>In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets you ride but ignores your control—retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Falling Off </H4>

<P>If an effect is about to move your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mount. </P>

<P>While mounted, you must make the same save if you’re knocked Prone or the mount is. </P>
</Sect>

<H3>Underwater Combat </H3>

<P>A fight underwater follows these rules. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Impeded Weapons </H4>

<P>When making a melee attack roll with a weapon underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon deals Piercing damage. </P>

<P>A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage against a target within normal range. </P>

<P>Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. </P>

<P>Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult </P>

<P>to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of </P>

<Sect>
<H6>RESTING </H6>

<P>Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring. They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main </P>

<P>benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the </P>

<P>rules for Short and Long Rests. </P>

<P>Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go. </P>

<P>Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points. </P>

<P>If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but which might trigger other game effects. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Damage Rolls </H3>

<P>Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability </P>

<P>specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to </P>

<P>your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage. </P>

<P>When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and “Spells” for spells’ damage dice. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Critical Hits </H3>

<P>When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them </P>

<P>together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal. </P>

<P>For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Saving Throws and Damage </H3>

<P>Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Damage against Multiple Targets </H4>

<P>When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Half Damage </H4>

<P>Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round down) to a target when the target succeeds on the saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half the damage that would be dealt on a failed save. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Damage Types </H3>

<P>Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Resistance and Vulnerability </H3>

<P>Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you. For example, if you have Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire damage, such damage is doubled against you. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>No Stacking </H4>

<P>Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage, Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Order of Application </H4>

<P>Modifiers to damage are applied in the following </P>

<P>order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or </P>

<P>multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied </P>

<P>second; and Vulnerability is applied third. </P>

<P>For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22). </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Immunity </H3>

<P>Some creatures and objects have Immunity to certain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a damage type means you don’t take damage of that type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t affected by it. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Healing </H3>

<P>Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”). </P>

<Sect>
<H6>KNOCKING OUT A CREATURE </H6>

<P>When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone </P>

<P>takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a </P>

<P>successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. </P>

<P>When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points </H3>

<P>When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Instant Death </H4>

<P>Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly. </P>

<P>Monster Death. A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character. </P>

<P>Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum. </P>

<P>Massive Damage. When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Character Demise </H4>

<P>If your character dies, others might find a magical </P>

<P>way to revive your character, such as with the Raise Dead spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has more information on being dead. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Falling Unconscious </H4>

<P>If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glossary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws (see below). </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H4>Death Saving Throws </H4>

<P>Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now. </P>

<P>Three Successes/Failures. Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a Character” below). On your third failure, you die. </P>

<P>The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d20 Duration </P>

<Sect>
<P>for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point. </P>

<P>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Stabilizing a Character </H4>

<P>You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. </P>

<P>A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Temporary Hit Points </H3>

<P>Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points, as explained below. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Lose Temporary Hit Points First </H4>

<P>If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, </P>

<P>those points are lost first, and any leftover damage </P>

<P>carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points. </P>

<P>Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>They Don’t Stack </H4>

<P>Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>They’re Not Hit Points or Healing </H4>

<P>Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary Hit Points. </P>

<P>If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you. </P>

<H1>Character Creation </H1>

<Sect>
<H2>Choose a Character Sheet </H2>

<P>You’ll record the main details of your character on a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character! </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Create Your Character </H2>

<P>Here are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail: </P>

<P>1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s vocation, special talents, and favored tactics. </P>

<P>2: Determine Origin. A character’s origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors? You can also choose your character’s languages. </P>

<P>3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character’s six abilities. </P>

<P>4: Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand for your character’s moral compass. </P>

<P>5: Fill in Details. Using the choices you’ve made, fill </P>

<P>in the remaining details on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Step 1: Choose Class </P>

<P>Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet. The Class Overview table summarizes the classes. See “Classes” for the classes’ details. </P>

<P>Wizard Spellbooks Intelligence Average </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Write Your Level </H4>

<P>Write your character’s level on your character sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP). </P>

<P>Write Your XP. Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP. </P>

<P>Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in “Character Creation” for more information. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Note Armor Training </H4>

<P>Your class might give you training with certain categories of armor. Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described in “Equipment.” </P>

<P>Step 2: Character Origin </P>

<P>Determining your character’s origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages. </P>

<P>A character’s background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character’s earliest days. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Choose a Background </H4>

<P>Choose your character’s background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options. </P>

<P>The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character’s ability scores. If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds benefit which ability scores. Look for your class’s primary ability there. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Ability Scores and Backgrounds Ability Background </H5>

<P>Strength Soldier </P>

<P>Dexterity Soldier </P>

<P>Constitution Soldier </P>

<P>Intelligence Acolyte </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Ability Background </H5>

<P>Wisdom Acolyte </P>

<P>Charisma Acolyte </P>

<P>Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Note Proficiencies. Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in “Classes” and note the proficiencies on your character sheet. </P>

<P>The features table in your class description shows </P>

<P>your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the </P>

<P>Game”), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this </P>

<P>number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Choose Starting Equipment </H4>

<P>Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from “Equipment.” </P>

<P>Record your chosen equipment on your character sheet. Equipment is described in “Equipment,” but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Choose a Species </H4>

<P>Choose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in “Character Origins”: </P>

<P>Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species’ traits. </P>

<P>Your character’s size and Speed are determined by the character’s species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Imagine Your Past and Present </H4>

<P>Let your character’s background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character’s present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character: </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Choose Languages </H4>

<P>Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages. </P>

<P>The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread in the setting. Every player character knows Common. The other standard languages originated with the first members of the most prominent species in the setting and have since spread widely. </P>

<P>Step 3: Ability Scores </P>

<P>To determine your character’s ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability means. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Generate Your Scores </H4>

<P>Determine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your GM might prefer you to use a particular one. </P>

<P>Standard Array. Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. </P>

<P>Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers. </P>

<P>Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points. </P>

<P>Step 4: Alignment </P>

<P>Choose your character’s alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet. </P>

<P>The game assumes that player characters aren’t of an evil alignment. Check with your GM before making an evil character. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>The Nine Alignments </H4>

<P>A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of </P>

<P>two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or </P>

<P>neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). </P>

<P>The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior. </P>

<P>Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good. </P>

<P>Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good. </P>

<P>Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good. </P>

<P>Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral. </P>

<P>Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides, </P>

<Sect>
<H6>UNALIGNED CREATURES </H6>

<P>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don’t have alignments; they are unaligned. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren’t evil; they are unaligned. </P>

<P>doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s bored by moral debate is probably Neutral. </P>

<P>Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral. </P>

<P>Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil. </P>

<P>Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil. </P>

<P>Chaotic Evil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil. </P>

<P>Step 5: Character Creation Details </P>

<P>Now fill in the rest of your character sheet. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Record Class Features </H4>

<P>Look at your class’s feature table in “Classes,” and write down the level 1 features. The class features are detailed there too. </P>

<P>Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Fill In Numbers </H4>

<P>Note these numbers on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Saving Throws. For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier. </P>

<P>Skills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier. </P>

<P>Passive Perception. Sometimes your GM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you’re not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score: </P>

<P>Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) </P>

<P>check modifier </P>

<P>Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom </P>

<P>(Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + </P>

<P>2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency). Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier </P>

<P>determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Level 1 Hit Points by Class Class Hit Point Maximum </H5>

<P>Barbarian 12 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 10 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, 8 + Con. modifier Rogue, or Warlock </P>

<P>Sorcerer or Wizard 6 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>The character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s also space to track Death Saving Throws. </P>

<P>Hit Point Dice. Your class’s description tells you the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent. </P>

<P>Initiative. Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet. </P>

<P>Armor Class. Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in “Equipment.” A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC. </P>

<P>Attacks. In the Weapons &amp; Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon’s property says otherwise: </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier </H5>

<P>+ Proficiency Bonus Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier  + Proficiency Bonus </P>

<P>Look up the damage and properties of your weapons in “Equipment.” You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon. </P>

<P>Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas: </P>

<P>Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier </P>

<P>+ Proficiency Bonus Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus </P>

<P>Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell. </P>

<P>Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them—along with your number of spell slots—on your character sheet. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Level Advancement </H2>

<P>While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A </P>

<P>character who reaches a specified Experience Point </P>

<P>total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level. </P>

<P>The Character Advancement table lists the XP you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level. </P>

<H3>Gaining a Level </H3>

<P>When you gain a level, follow these steps: </P>

<P>1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the rules in the “Multiclassing” section. </P>

<P>2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points by Class table. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Fixed Hit Points by Class Class Hit Points per Level </H5>

<P>Barbarian 7 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 6 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, 5 + Con. modifier Rogue, or Warlock </P>

<P>Sorcerer or Wizard 4 + Con. modifier </P>

<P>3: Record New Class Features. Look at your class features table in “Classes,” and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature. </P>

<P>4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Pro</P>

<P>ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as </P>

<P>shown in the Character Advancement table and your class features table in “Classes.” When your </P>

<P>Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the </P>

<P>numbers on your character sheet that include </P>

<P>your Proficiency Bonus. </P>

<P>5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat that increases one or more of your ability scores, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Tiers of Play </H3>

<P>With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s (and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 character just beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as characters gain levels. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Tier 1 (Levels 1–4) </H4>

<P>In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Tier 2 (Levels 5–10) </H4>

<P>In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. </P>

<P>Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Tier 3 (Levels 11–16) </H4>

<P>In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Tier 4 (Levels 17–20) </H4>

<P>At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Starting at Higher Levels </H2>

<P>Your GM might start your group’s characters at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&amp;D players. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Creating Your Character </H3>

<P>Creating a higher-level character uses the same character-creation steps outlined in this chapter and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Starting Equipment at Higher Levels Starting Level Equipment and Money </H5>

<P>BONUS FEATS AT LEVEL 20 </P>

<P>A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can choose any feat for which their level 20 character </P>

<P>qualifies. </P>

<P>in the “Level Advancement” section. You begin with the minimum amount of XP required to reach your starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at level 10, you have 64,000 XP. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Starting Equipment </H3>

<P>The GM decides whether your character starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 character, possibly even one or more magic items. The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a guide for the GM. </P>

<P>Also, check with your GM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money. For example, the firearms described in “Equipment” are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they might be available for purchase if your GM allows them. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H2>Multiclassing </H2>

<P>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be re</P>

<P>flected in a single class. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H3>Prerequisites </H3>

<P>To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, </P>

</Sect>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H3>Experience Points </H3>

<P>The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Hit Points and Hit Point Dice </H3>

<P>You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1. </P>

<P>Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Proficiency Bonus </H3>

<P>Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Proficiencies </H3>

<P>When you gain your first level in a class other than </P>

<P>your initial class, you gain only some of the new </P>

<P>class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each </P>

<P>class’s description in “Classes.” </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H3>Class Features </H3>

<P>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your classes’ descriptions. </P>

<P>Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Armor Class </H4>

<P>If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor </P>

<P>Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. </P>

<P>For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Extra Attack </H4>

<P>If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter’s Two Extra Attacks feature). </P>

<P>Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H4>Spellcasting </H4>

<P>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class. </P>

<P>Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips). </P>

<P>Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. </P>

<P>Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have. </P>

<P>This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal. </P>

<P>For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown </P>
</Sect>

<P>in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four Trinkets </P>

<P>tution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit. </P>

<P>Level 1: Weapon Mastery </P>

<P>Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Great-</P>

<P>axes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long </P>

<P>Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices. </P>

<P>When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table. </P>

<P>Level 2: Danger Sense </P>

<P>You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition. </P>

<P>Level 2: Reckless Attack </P>

<P>You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time. </P>

<P>Level 3: Barbarian Subclass </P>

<P>You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower. </P>

<P>Level 3: Primal Knowledge </P>

<P>You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice </P>

<P>from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1. </P>

<P>In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses. </P>

<P>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </P>

<P>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16. </P>

<P>Level 5: Extra Attack </P>

<P>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </P>

<P>Level 5: Fast Movement </P>

<P>Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. </P>

<P>Level 7: Feral Instinct </P>

<P>Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls. </P>

<P>Level 7: Instinctive Pounce </P>

<P>As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed. </P>

<P>Level 9: Brutal Strike </P>

<P>If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options. </P>

<P>Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks. </P>

<P>Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one. </P>

<P>Level 11: Relentless Rage </P>

<P>Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous </P>

<P>wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level. </P>

<P>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10. </P>

<P>Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike </P>

<P>You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options. </P>

<P>Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn. </P>

<P>Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus. </P>

<P>Level 15: Persistent Rage </P>

<P>When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage </P>

<P>in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a </P>

<P>Long Rest. </P>

<P>In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor. </P>

<P>Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike </P>

<P>The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature. </P>

<P>Level 18: Indomitable Might </P>

<P>If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. </P>

<P>Level 19: Epic Boon </P>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended. </P>

<P>Level 20: Primal Champion </P>

<P>You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25. </P>

<P>Barbarian Subclass: Path of the Berserker </P>

<P>Channel Rage into Violent Fury </P>

<P>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them. </P>

<P>Level 3: Frenzy </P>

<P>If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, </P>

<P>you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on </P>

<P>your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack. </P>

<P>Level 6: Mindless Rage </P>

<P>You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you. </P>

<P>Level 10: Retaliation </P>

<P>When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. </P>

<P>Level 14: Intimidating Presence </P>

<P>As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength </P>

<P>modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, </P>

<P>a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. </P>

<P>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again </P>

<P>until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use </P>

<P>of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it. </P>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H4>Level 1: Spellcasting </H4>

<P>You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list. </P>

<P>When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. </P>

<P>If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Expertise </H4>

<P>You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of </P>

<P>your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them. </P>

<P>At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of </P>

<P>your skill proficiencies of your choice. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Jack of All Trades </H4>

<P>You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round </P>

<P>down) to any ability check you make that uses a </P>

<P>skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus. </P>

<P>For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Bard Subclass </H4>

<P>You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </H4>

<P>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 5: Font of Inspiration </H4>

<P>You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic In</P>

<P>spiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest. </P>

<P>In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration. </P>

<P>Level 7: Countercharm </P>

<P>You can use musical notes or words of power to dis</P>

<P>rupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature </P>

<P>within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 10: Magical Secrets </H4>

<P>You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists. </P>

<P>Level 18: Superior Inspiration </P>

<P>When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that. </P>

<P>Level 19: Epic Boon </P>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended. </P>

<P>Level 20: Words of Creation </P>

<P>within 10 feet of the first target. </P>

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure. </P>

<H4>Level 1: Divine Order </H4>

<P>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. </P>

<P>Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor. </P>

<P>Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 2: Channel Divinity </H4>

<P>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels. </P>

<P>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. </P>

<P>You regain one of its expended uses when you finish </P>

<P>a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses </P>

<P>when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table. </P>

<P>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. </P>

<P>Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down). </P>

<P>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8). </P>

<P>Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 3: Cleric Subclass </H4>

<P>You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels.

</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </H4>

<P>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<Sect>
<H4>Level 5: Sear Undead </H4>

<P>Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a </P>

<P>number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier </P>

<P>(minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Level 7: Blessed Strikes Cantrips (Level 0 Cleric Spells) </H5>

<Sect>
<P>Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature). </P>

<P>Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice). </P>

<P>Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier </P>

<P>to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 10: Divine Intervention </H4>

<P>You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature </P>

<P>again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes </H4>

<P>The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful. </P>

<P>Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8. </P>

<P>Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric can-trip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 19: Epic Boon </H4>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention </H4>

<P>You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again </P>

<P>until you finish 2d4 Long Rests. </P>

<H3>Cleric Subclass: Life Domain </H3>

<P>Soothe the Hurts of the World </P>

<P>The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts. </P>

<P>Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Disciple of Life </H4>

<P>When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Life Domain Spells </H4>

<P>Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Preserve Life </H4>

<P>As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit </P>

<P>Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose </P>

<P>Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 6: Blessed Healer </H4>

<P>The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 17: Supreme Healing </H4>

<P>When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12. </P>

<P>how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. </P>

<P>When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. </P>

<P>If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. </P>

<H4>Level 1: Primal Order </H4>

<P>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. </P>

<P>Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your </P>

<P>Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency </P>

<P>with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Wild Shape </H4>

<P>The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action. </P>

<P>Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. </P>

<P>You regain one expended use when you finish a </P>

<P>Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table. </P>

<P>Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. </P>

<P>When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed. </P>

<P>When choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so. </P>

<P>Beast Shapes </P>

<P>Druid Known Max Fly Level Forms CR Speed </P>

<P>2 4 1/4 No </P>

<P>4 6 1/2 No </P>

<P>8 8 1Yes </P>

<P>Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply: </P>

<P>Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. </P>

<P>Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher </P>

<P>than yours, use the one in the stat block. </P>

<P>No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. </P>

<P>Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Wild Companion </H4>

<P>You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components. </P>

<P>When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is </P>

<P>Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Druid Subclass </H4>

<P>You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </H4>

<P>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 5: Wild Resurgence </H4>

<P>Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required). </P>

<P>In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 7: Elemental Fury </H4>

<P>The might of the elements flows through you. You </P>

<P>gain one of the following options of your choice. </P>

<P>Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier </P>

<P>to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip. </P>

<P>Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury </H4>

<P>The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below. </P>

<P>Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid can-trip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet. </P>

<P>Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 18: Beast Spells </H4>

<P>While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material com</P>

<P>ponent with a cost specified or that consumes its </P>

<P>Material component. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 19: Epic Boon </H4>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H4>Level 20: Archdruid </H4>

<P>The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, </P>

<P>granting you the following benefits. </P>

<P>Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it. </P>

<P>Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Longevity. The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year. </P>

<P>Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns </P>

<P>appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points. </P>

<P>The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6). </P>

<P>Level 6: Natural Recovery </P>

<P>You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without </P>

<P>expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long </P>

<P>Rest before you do so again. </P>

<P>In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Level 1: Second Wind </P>

<P>You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level. </P>

<P>You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>You have a mind for tactics on and off the battle</P>

<P>field. When you fail an ability check, you can expend </P>

<P>Level 3: Fighter Subclass </P>

<P>You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels.

<P>Level 9: Indomitable </P>

<P>If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17. </P>

<P>Level 9: Tactical Master </P>

<P>When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack. </P>

<P>Level 11: Two Extra Attacks </P>

<P>You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </P>

<P>Level 13: Studied Attacks </P>

<P>Level 19: Epic Boon </P>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended. </P>

<P>Level 20: Three Extra Attacks </P>

<P>You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </P>

<P>Fighter Subclass: Champion </P>

<P>Level 3: Remarkable Athlete </P>

<P>Thanks to your athleticism, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Strength (Athletics) checks. </P>

<P>In addition, immediately after you score a Critical Hit, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks. </P>

<P>Level 7: Additional Fighting Style </P>

<P>You gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice. </P>

<P>Level 10: Heroic Warrior </P>

<P>The thrill of battle drives you toward victory. During combat, you can give yourself Heroic Inspiration whenever you start your turn without it. </P>

<P>Level 15: Superior Critical </P>

<P>Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can now score a Critical Hit on a roll of 18–20 on the d20. </P>

<P>Level 18: Survivor </P>

<P>The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts. </P>

<P>Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain. </P>

<P>As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit </P>

<P>Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose </P>

<P>Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum. </P>

<H4>Level 6: Blessed Healer </H4>

<P>The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level. </P>

<H4>Level 17: Supreme Healing </H4>

<P>When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die.

<P>how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. </P>

<P>When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. </P>

<P>If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. </P>

<H4>Level 1: Druidic </H4>

<P>You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared. </P>

<P>You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 1: Primal Order </H4>

<P>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. </P>

<P>Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your </P>

<P>Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency </P>

<P>with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Wild Shape </H4>

<P>The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action. </P>

<P>Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. </P>

<P>You regain one expended use when you finish a </P>

<P>Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table. </P>

<P>Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. </P>

<P>When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed. </P>

<P>When choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so. </P>

<P>Beast Shapes </P>

<P>Druid Known Max Fly Level Forms CR Speed </P>

<P>2 4 1/4 No </P>

<P>4 6 1/2 No </P>

<P>8 8 1Yes </P>

<P>Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply: </P>

<P>Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. </P>

<P>Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher </P>

<P>than yours, use the one in the stat block. </P>

<P>No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. </P>

<P>Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 2: Wild Companion </H4>

<P>You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components. </P>

<P>When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is </P>

<P>Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>

<P>As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. </P>

<P>Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns </P>

<P>appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points. </P>

<P>The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6). </P>

<P>Level 6: Natural Recovery </P>

<P>You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without </P>

<P>expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long </P>

<P>Rest before you do so again. </P>

<P>In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Level 10: Nature’s Ward </P>

<P>You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature’s Ward table. </P>

They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there. </P>

<P>Level 9: Indomitable </P>

<P>If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17. </P>

<P>Level 9: Tactical Master </P>

<P>When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack. </P>

<P>Level 11: Two Extra Attacks </P>

<P>You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </P>

<P>You gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice. </P>

<Sect>
<P>As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. </P>

<P>You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature. </P>

<P>Level 1: Spellcasting </P>

<P>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. </P>

<P>If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you </P>

<P>finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your </P>

<P>list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells. </P>

<P>Level 1: Weapon Mastery </P>

<P>Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your </P>

<P>choice with which you have proficiency, such as </P>

<P>Longswords and Javelins. </P>

<P>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change </P>

<P>the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails. </P>

<P>Level 2: Fighting Style </P>

<P>You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see “Feats” for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. </P>

<P>Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip. </P>

<P>Level 2: Paladin’s Smite </P>

<P>You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell </P>

<P>slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can </P>

<P>cast it in this way again. </P>

<P>Level 3: Channel Divinity </P>

<P>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create. </P>

<P>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. </P>

<P>You regain one of its expended uses when you finish </P>

<P>a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when </P>

<P>you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use </P>

<P>when you reach Paladin level 11. </P>

<P>BREAKING YOUR OATH </P>

<P>A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath. </P>

<P>A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh. </P>

<P>If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

</Part>
<Part>
<H4>Level 3: Paladin Subclass </H4>

<P>You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. </P>

<P>You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 6: Aura of Protection </H4>

<P>You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. </P>

<P>You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to </P>

<P>saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier </P>

<P>(minimum bonus of +1). If another Paladin is present, a creature can ben</P>

<P>efit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the </P>

</Sect>

<P>Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that </P>

<P>you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 14: Restoring Touch </H4>

<P>When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature. </P>

<TD>Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor. Level 3: Draconic Resilience The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level. Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers. </TD>

<P>qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. </P>

<P>When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table. </P>

<P>You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise. </P>

<P>Level 1: Pact Magic </P>

<P>Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. </P>

<P>The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability </P>

<P>to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spell-casting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. </P>

<P>When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table. </P>

<P>10 4 15 45 </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest. </P>

<P>For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3. </P>

<P>If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells. </P>

<P>Level 2: Magical Cunning </P>

<P>You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you </P>

<P>can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Level 3: Warlock Subclass </P>

<P>You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower. </P>

<P>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </P>

<P>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16. </P>

<P>Level 9: Contact Patron </P>

<P>In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. </P>

<P>Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t </P>

<P>do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Level 11: Mystic Arcanum </P>

<P>Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. </P>

<P>You can cast your arcanum spell once without ex</P>

<P>pending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest </P>

<P>before you can cast it in this way again. </P>

<P>As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level. </P>

<P>Level 19: Epic Boon </P>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. </P>

<P>Level 20: Eldritch Master </P>

<P>When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots. </P>

The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way. </P>

<P>you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus. Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, </P>

<P>you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack </P>

<P>and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type. </P>

<P>Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends. </P>

<P>can access, granting you the benefits below. The </P>

<P>book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die. </P>

<P>Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag.

<Part>
<H4>Level 1: Pact Magic </H4>

<P>Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. </P>

<P>The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability </P>

<P>to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spell-casting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description. </P>

<P>Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. </P>

<P>When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table. </P>

<P>10 4 15 45 </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest. </P>

<P>For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3. </P>

<P>If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 2: Magical Cunning </H4>

<P>You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you </P>

<P>can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 3: Warlock Subclass </H4>

<P>You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement </H4>

</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 9: Contact Patron </H4>

<P>In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. </P>

<P>Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t </P>

<P>do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Level 11: Mystic Arcanum </H4>

<P>Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. </P>

<P>You can cast your arcanum spell once without ex</P>

<P>pending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest </P>

<P>before you can cast it in this way again. </P>

<P>As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level. </P>

<P>Level 19: Epic Boon </P>

<P>You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. </P>

<P>When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table. </P>

<P>Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine. </P>

<P>The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended. </P>

<P>Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly. </P>

<P>Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </P>

<P>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. </P>

<P>If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you. </P>

<P>Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells. </P>

<P>Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. </P>

<P>Level 1: Ritual Adept </P>

<P>You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Level 1: Arcane Recovery </P>

<P>You can regain some of your magical energy by </P>

<P>studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short </P>

<P>Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again </P>
</Sect>

<P>until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

<P>Level 2: Scholar </P>

<P>While studying magic, you also specialized in an</P>

<P>other field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill. </P>

<P>Level 3: Wizard Subclass </P>

<P>You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest </P>

<Sect>
<P>EXPANDING AND REPLACING A SPELLBOOK </P>

<P>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain </P>

<P>levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that </P>

<P>you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook. </P>

<P>Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find </P>

<P>a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook. </P>

<P>Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell. </P>

<P>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the </P>

<P>remainder of the new book requires you to find new </P>

<P>spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook. </P>

<H3>Wizard Subclass: Evoker </H3>

<P>Create Explosive Elemental Effects </P>

<P>Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful </P>

<P>elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, </P>

<P>rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning </P>

<P>acid. Some Evokers find employment in military </P>

<P>forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Evocation Savant </H4>

<P>Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. </P>

<P>In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spell-book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 3: Potent Cantrip </H4>

<P>Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can-trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 6: Sculpt Spells </H4>

<P>You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 10: Empowered Evocation </H4>

<P>Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca</P>

<P>tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier </P>

<P>to one damage roll of that spell. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Level 14: Overchannel </H4>

<P>You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it. </P>

<P>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity. </P>

<P>Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. </P>

<P>Some species can trace their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to many different cultures. </P>

<P>Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span. </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>

Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). </P>

During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Properties </H3>

<P>Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table. </P>

<P>Ammunition </P>

<P>You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have </P>

<P>ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each </P>

<P>attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a </P>

<P>fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the </P>

<P>rest is lost. </P>

<P>Finesse </P>

<P>When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use </P>

<P>your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier </P>

<P>for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the </P>

<P>same modifier for both rolls. </P>

<P>Heavy </P>

<P>You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13. </P>

<P>Light </P>

<P>When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a </P>

<P>Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you </P>

<P>don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the </P>

<P>damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi</P>

<P>fier is negative. </P>

<P>Loading </P>

<P>You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a </P>

<P>Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus </P>

<P>Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the </P>

<P>number of attacks you can normally make. </P>

<P>Range </P>

<P>A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range </P>

<P>lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal </P>

<P>range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range. </P>

<P>Reach </P>

<P>A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it. </P>

<P>Thrown </P>

<P>If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability </P>

<P>modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you </P>

<P>use for a melee attack with that weapon. </P>

<P>Two-Handed </P>

<P>A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. </P>

<P>Versatile </P>

<P>A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Mastery Properties </H3>

<H6>iMprovisEd wEapons </H6>

<P>If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack. </P>

<P>Cleave </P>

<P>If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet </P>

<P>of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, </P>

<P>the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, </P>

<P>but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this </P>

<P>extra attack only once per turn. </P>

<P>Graze </P>

<P>If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal </P>

<P>to the ability modifier you used to make the attack </P>

<P>roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by </P>

<P>increasing the ability modifier. </P>

<P>Nick </P>

<P>When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn. </P>

<P>Topple </P>

<P>If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw </P>

<P>(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed </P>

<H3>Wearing and Wielding Items </H3>

<P>Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, </P>

<P>and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, </P>

<P>a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held. </P>

<P>In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Multiple Items of the Same Kind </H4>

<P>You can’t wear more than one of certain magic items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Paired Items </H4>

<P>Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only </P>

<P>if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot </P>

<P>gains no benefit from either. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Crafting Nonmagical Items </H2>

<P>To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Tools </H3>

<P>The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools are required to make certain items. The GM assigns required tools for items not listed there. </P>

<P>You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Raw Materials </H3>

<P>To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Time </H3>

<P>To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP. </P>

<P>If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t be consecutive. </P>

<P>Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Brewing Potions of Healing </H2>

<P>A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism </P>

<P>Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work). </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Scribing Spell Scrolls </H2>

<P>A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a Spell Scroll, using the rules below. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Time and Cost </H3>

<P>Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Prerequisites for the Scribe </H3>

<P>To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the </P>

<P>Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Cantrips </H3>

<P>If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level. </P>

<P>Spell Scroll Costs Spell Level Time Cost </P>

<P>Cantrip 1 day 15 GP </P>

<P>1 1 day 25 GP </P>

<P>2 3 days 100 GP </P>

<P>3 5 days 150 GP </P>

<P>4 10 days 1,000 GP </P>

<P>5 25 days 1,500 GP </P>

<P>6 40 days 10,000 GP </P>

<P>7 50 days 12,500 GP </P>

<H1>Spells </H1>

<P>Gaining Spells </P>

<P>Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Preparing Spells </H3>

<P>If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your </P>

<P>spellcasting feature specifies when you can change </P>

<P>the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Spell Preparation by Class </H5>

<P>Class Change When You Number of Spells … </P>

<P>Bard Gain a level One </P>

<P>Cleric Finish a Long Rest Any </P>

<P>Druid Finish a Long Rest Any </P>

<P>Paladin Finish a Long Rest One </P>

<P>Ranger Finish a Long Rest One </P>

<P>Sorcerer Gain a level One </P>

<P>Warlock Gain a level One </P>

<P>Wizard Finish a Long Rest Any </P>

<P>Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Always-Prepared Spells </H3>

<P>Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn’t count against the number of spells on that list. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Casting Spells </H2>

<P>Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following sections explain each of those entries, which follow a spell’s name. </P>

<Sect>
<H6>CASTING IN ARMOR </H6>

<P>You must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise too hampered by the armor for spellcasting. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Spell Level </H3>

<P>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an </P>

<P>indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. </P>

<P>The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Spell Slots </H4>

<P>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots. </P>

<P>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that </P>

<P>spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with </P>

<P>the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a high-er-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at </P>

<P>least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining. </P>

<P>Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Casting without Slots </H4>

<P>There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot: </P>

<P>Cantrips. A cantrip is cast without a spell slot. </P>

<P>Rituals. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared. </P>

<P>Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day. </P>

<P>Magic Items. Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item speci</P>

<P>fies how many times a spell can be cast from it. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot </H4>

<P>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands </P>

<P>to fill the slot it is put into. </P>
</Sect>

<H3>School of Magic </H3>

<P>Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rules refer to them. </P>

<H3>Class Spell Lists </H3>

<P>If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a class in the parentheses. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Casting Time </H3>

<P>Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry speci</P>

<P>fies which of those is required. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn </H4>

<P>On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers </H4>

<P>A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast </P>

<P>in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s </P>

<P>Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a </P>

<P>trigger defined in the spell. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Longer Casting Times </H4>

<P>Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Ritual—require more time to cast: minutes or even </P>

<P>hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you must start over. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Range </H3>

<P>A spell’s range indicates how far from the spell-caster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range. </P>

<P>A range usually takes one of the following forms: </P>

<P>Distance. The range is expressed in feet. Touch. The spell’s effect originates on something, </P>

<P>as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must </P>

<P>touch within their reach. Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates </P>

<P>from them, as specified in the spell. </P>

<P>If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted by its range unless the spell’s description says otherwise. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Components </H3>

<P>A spell’s components are physical requirements the spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Verbal (V) </H4>

<P>A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of </P>

<P>sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the </P>

<P>threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a spell with a Verbal component. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Somatic (S) </H4>

<P>A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Material (M) </H4>

<P>A Material component is a particular material used </P>

<P>in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in </P>

<P>the Components entry. These materials aren’t consumed by the spell unless the spell’s description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform Somatic components, if any. </P>

<P>If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of providing the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you must hold it unless its description says otherwise (see “Equipment” for descriptions). </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Duration </H3>

<P>A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms: </P>

<P>Concentration. A duration that requires Concentration follows the Concentration rules (see “Rules Glossary”). </P>

<P>Instantaneous. An instantaneous duration means the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and then disappears. </P>

<P>Time Span. A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action required) if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<Sect>
<H3>Effects </H3>

<P>The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any outcomes beyond those effects are under the GM’s purview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all three, each of which is detailed below. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H4>Targets </H4>

<P>A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else. </P>

<P>A Clear Path to the Target. To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind Total Cover. </P>

<P>Targeting Yourself. If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you. </P>

<P>Areas of Effect. Some spells, such as Thunder-wave, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in “Rules Glossary.” The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Awareness of Being Targeted. Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s description says otherwise. </P>

<P>Invalid Targets. If you cast a spell on someone or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. </P>

<P>If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Saving Throws </H4>

<P>Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The </P>

<P>spell specifies the ability that the target uses for </P>

<P>the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells: </P>

<Sect>
<P>Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier </P>

<P>+ your Proficiency Bonus </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Attack Rolls </H4>

<P>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. </P>

<P>Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your </P>

<P>spells: </P>

<Sect>
<P>Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability </P>

<P>modifier + your Proficiency Bonus </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Combining Spell Effects </H4>

<P>The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their </P>

<P>durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on </P>

<P>the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit </P>

<P>only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second Bless ends. </P>

<Sect>
<P>IDENTIFYING AN ONGOING SPELL </P>

<P>You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and suc</P>

<P>ceed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. </P>

<P>Level 2 Evocation (Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 90 feet Components: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf) Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2. </P>

<P>ACID SPLASH </P>

<P>Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage. </P>

<P>Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6). </P>

<P>Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a bell and silver wire) Duration: 8 hours </P>

<P>You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental: </P>

<P>Audible Alarm. The alarm produces the sound of </P>

<P>a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the </P>

<P>warded area. Mental Alarm. You are alerted by a mental ping </P>

<P>if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This </P>

<P>ping awakens you if you’re asleep. </P>

<H4>Alter Self </H4>

<P>Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour </P>

<P>You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one. </P>

<P>Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed. </P>

<P>Change Appearance. You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again. </P>

<P>Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength. </P>

<P>Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends. </P>

<P>Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a morsel of food) Duration: 24 hours </P>

<P>A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target’s Challenge Rating isn’t 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of </P>

<P>up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering </P>

<P>about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast </P>

<P>can fly. </P>

<P>When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell. </P>

<P>Level 8 Transmutation (Druid) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: 24 hours </P>

<P>Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a Magic action to transform the targets again. </P>

<P>A target’s game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast’s statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target’s actions are limited by the Beast form’s anatomy, and it can’t cast spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new form, and the target can’t use any of that equipment while in that form. </P>

<P>The target gains a number of Temporary Hit </P>

<P>Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into </P>

<P>which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target ends it as a Bonus Action. </P>

<H4>Animate Dead </H4>

<P>Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute Range: 10 feet Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, </P>

<P>and a pinch of bone dust) Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters” for the stat blocks). </P>

<P>On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. </P>

<P>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it.

<P>As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target.

<P>Antipathy. The creature has the Frightened condi</P>

<P>tion. The Frightened creature must use its move</P>

<P>tion. The Charmed creature must use its move</P>

<P>target, moving by the safest route. If the creature </P>

<P>is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can’t </P>

<P>scribed below. </P>

<P>Ending the Effect. If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw.

<P>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane).

<P>A target’s astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target’s body and astral form both die. </P>

<P>A target’s astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target’s body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane. </P>

<P>Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. </P>

<P>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. </P>

<P>Part Water. You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. </P>

<P>Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the </P>

<P>area to move in a direction you choose, even if the </P>

<P>water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in </P>

<P>other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the </P>

<P>spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. </P>

<P>The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. </P>

<P>Whirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

<P>As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete. </P>

<P>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends.

<P>A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration.

A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>The spell’s base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn’t ended. </P>

<P>If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode.

<P>Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell.

<P>You target a creature you know on the same plane of existence. You or a willing creature you touch enters a trance state to act as a dream messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0. </P>

<P>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the spell’s duration. The messenger can also shape the dream’s environment, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the spell. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. </P>

<P>If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to sleep, at which point the messenger enters its dreams. </P>

<P>You can make the messenger terrifying to the target. If you do so, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words, and then the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and it takes 3d6 Psychic damage when it wakes up. </P>

A creature in the same space as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. </P>

<P>Structures. The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses. </P>

<P>A creature within a distance from a collapsing structure equal to half the structure’s height makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the Prone condition, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.

It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom. </P>

<P>You create a ward against magical travel that pro</P>

<P>tects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, </P>

<P>creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the Gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the Plane Shift spell. </P>

<P>In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature of a chosen type enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell). </P>

<P>You can designate a password when you cast the spell. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell. </P>

<P>The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another Forbiddance spell. If you cast Forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are consumed on the last casting. </P>

<P>An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. </P>

<P>A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area. </P>

<P>When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside it. </P>

<P>A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. </P>

<P>A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to break free. </P>

<P>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell’s casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. </P>

<P>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose.

<P>The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. </P>

<P>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains. </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 hour Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+ </P>

<P>GP, which the spell consumes) Duration: Until dispelled or triggered </P>

<P>You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a </P>

<P>table or a section of floor) or within an object that </P>

<P>can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. </P>

<P>The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice. </P>

<P>When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below. </P>

<P>Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. </P>

<P>You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. </P>

<P>Explosive Rune. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. </P>

<P>When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the Glyph of Warding. </P>

<P>The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known.

<H4>Magic Jar </H4>

<P>Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth </P>

<P>500+ GP) </P>

<P>Duration: Until dispelled </P>

<P>Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid’s body. </P>

<P>You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours. </P>

<P>Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move and it is Incapacitated. </P>

<P>While possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die. </P>

<P>If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. </P>

<P>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed. </P>

<H4>Magic Mouth </H4>

<P>Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which </P>

<P>the spell consumes) Duration: Until dispelled </P>

<P>You implant a message within an object in range—a </P>

<P>message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message. </P>

<P>When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs. </P>

<P>The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it. </P>

<H4>Magic Weapon </H4>

<P>Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute Range: 300 feet Components: V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP) Duration: 24 hours </P>

<P>You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts for the duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door remains open. You can open or close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible. </P>

<P>Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling’s atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. </P>

<P>You can create any floor plan you like for the dwelling, but it can’t exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from it. </P>

<P>A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You determine the appearance of these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can perform tasks that a human could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can’t leave the dwelling. </P>

<P>When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance. </P>

<P>Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes </P>

<P>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can’t deal damage or cause conditions. </P>

<P>If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. </P>

<P>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot. </P>

<P>You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures </P>

<P>you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, “Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour.” </P>

<P>Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days). </P>

<P>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. </P>

<P>The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. </P>

<P>You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. </P>

<P>While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move. </P>

<P>Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and have the Prone condition. </P>

<P>different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the </P>

<P>area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only </P>

<P>Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 30 feet Components: S, M (a bit of fleece) Duration: 1 minute </P>

<P>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again. </P>

<P>If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature. </P>

<P>Sound. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. </P>

<P>Image. If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. </P>

<H4>Mirage Arcane </H4>

<P>Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard) </P>

<P>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other </P>

<P>sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made </P>

<P>to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. </P>

<P>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures. </P>

<P>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground </P>

<P>into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise </P>

<P>impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately. </P>

<P>Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion. </P>

<H4>Mirror Image </H4>

<P>Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) </P>

<P>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. </P>

<P>Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed. </P>

<P>A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight. </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: Self Components: S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour </P>

<P>You gain the Invisible condition at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell. </P>

<P>As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable. </P>

<P>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. </P>

<H4>Modify Memory </H4>

<P>Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute </P>

<P>You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see within range </P>

<P>makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting </P>

<P>the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another </P>

<P>spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified. </P>

<P>While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s details, or create a memory of some other event. </P>

<P>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends. </P>

<P>A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature. </P>

<P>A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature’s past (level 9 spell slot). </P>

<P>Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a miniature shovel) Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours </P>

<P>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s eleva</P>

<P>tion, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, </P>

<P>or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. </P>

<P>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range. </P>

<P>This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. </P>

<P>Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it. </P>

<P>Duration: 8 hours </P>

<P>For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from Divination spells. The target can be a willing creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived through magical scrying sensors. </P>

<H4>Passwall </H4>

<P>Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard) </P>

<P>A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it. </P>

<P>When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell. </P>

<H4>Phantasmal Force </H4>

<P>Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute </P>

<P>You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli. </P>

<P>The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. </P>

<P>While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall. </P>

<P>An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion. </P>

<H4>Phantasmal Killer </H4>

<P>Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute </P>

<P>You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends. </P>

<P>For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4. </P>

<H4>Phantom Steed </H4>

<P>Level 3 Illusion (Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: 1 hour </P>

<P>A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed. </P>

<P>For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Planar Ally </H4>

<P>Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied </P>

<P>space within range. If you know a specific creature’s </P>

<P>name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice). </P>

<P>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. </P>

<P>Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. </P>

<P>A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. </P>

<P>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Duration: 24 hours </H5>

<P>You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. </P>

<P>(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the </P>

<P>center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. </P>

<P>A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days). </P>

<P>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemental Plane of Fire or palace on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the GM. </P>

<P>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle. </P>

<P>This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below. </P>

<P>Overgrowth. Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected. </P>

<P>Enrichment. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per year. </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour </P>

<P>You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level if it doesn’t have a Challenge Rating). The target’s game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice. See the “Animals” section of “Monsters” for a sample of Beast stat blocks. </P>

<P>The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left. </P>

<P>The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells. </P>

<P>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The </P>

<P>Level 9 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: 10 minutes </P>

<P>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms </P>

<P>a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within </P>

<P>range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect. </P>

<P>The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. </P>

<P>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table. </P>

<P>The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means </P>

<P>specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is </P>

<P>gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can affect only the violet layer. </P>

<P>Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to </P>

<P>Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP) Duration: Until dispelled </P>

<P>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. </P>

<P>When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again. </P>

<P>The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door. </P>

<P>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature. </P>

<P>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends. </P>

<P>You can see through the illusion’s eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly. </P>

<P>the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the </P>

<P>in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. </P>

<P>You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. </P>

<P>Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a </P>

<P>60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the </P>

<P>Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn </P>

<P>there. A creature is targeted only once per turn. </P>

<P>Death. Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save. </P>

<P>Discord. Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. </P>

<P>Fear. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. </P>

<P>Pain. Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition for 1 minute. </P>

<P>Sleep. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake. </P>

<P>Stunning. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute. </P>

<P>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on your later turns before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell. </P>

<P>Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell’s range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save. </P>

<P>Object. You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell’s range. </P>

If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. </P>

<P>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it. </P>

<P>Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in </P>

<P>a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the </P>

<P>As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. </P>

<P>Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern. </P>

<P>When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute. </P>

<P>The glossary uses the following conventions: </P>

<P>Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].” </P>

<P>A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family </P>

<P>of rules. The tags also have glossary entries. “You.” The game’s rules—in this glossary and else-where—often talk about something happening </P>

<P>to you in the game world. That “you” refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the “you” in the Prone condition is a creature that currently has that condition. </P>

<P>“See Also.” Some glossary entries include a See also section that points to other entries in the glossary, to other parts of this document, or both. </P>

<P>No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index. </P>

<H2>Rules Definitions </H2>

<P>Here are definitions of various rules. </P>

<P>Ability Check </P>

<P>An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using </P>

<P>one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated with an ability—to overcome a challenge. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”). </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Ability Score and Modifier </H4>

<P>A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test </P>

<P>with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so. See also “Playing the Game” (“The Six Abilities”). </P>

<P>Action </P>

<P>On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which action to take from those below or from the special actions provided by your features. See also “Playing </P>

<P>the Game” (“Actions”). These actions are defined </P>

<P>Advantage </P>

<P>If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s, and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”). </P>

<P>Adventure </P>

<P>An adventure is a series of encounters. A story emerges through playing them. See also “Encounter.” </P>

<P>Alignment </P>

<P>A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of </P>

<P>two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or </P>

<P>neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors allow for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful Good and Neutral Evil. See also “Character Creation” (“Create Your Character”). </P>

<P>Ally </P>

<P>A creature is your ally if it is a member of your adventuring party, your friend, on your side in combat, or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as your ally. </P>

<P>Area of Effect </P>

<P>The descriptions of many spells and other features specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de</P>

<P>fined elsewhere in this glossary: </P>

<P>Cone Cylinder Line Cube Emanation Sphere </P>

<P>An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn’t included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total Cover. See also “Cover.” </P>

<P>If the creator of an area of effect places it at an </P>

<P>unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall— </P>

<P>is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction. </P>

<P>Armor Class </P>

<P>An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an </P>

<P>attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a </P>

<P>target. </P>

<P>Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t use more than one. See also “Attack Roll.” </P>

<P>Armor Training </P>

<P>Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain category without the following drawbacks. If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also “Disadvantage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”). </P>

<P>Attack [Action] </P>

<P>When you take the Attack action, you can make one attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. </P>

<P>Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can either equip or unequip one weapon when you make an attack as part of this action. You do so either before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it. </P>

<P>Moving between Attacks. If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks. </P>

<P>Attack Roll </P>

<P>An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a spell. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”). </P>

<P>Attitude </P>

<P>A monster has a starting attitude toward a player character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also </P>

<P>“Friendly,” “Hostile,” “Indifferent,” and “Influence.” </P>

<P>Attunement </P>

<P>Some magic items require a creature to form a </P>

<P>bond—called Attunement—with them before the </P>

<P>creature can use an item’s magical properties. A creature can have Attunement with no more than three magic items at a time. See also “Equipment” (“Magic Items”). </P>

<P>Blinded [Condition] </P>

<P>While you have the Blinded condition, you experience the following effects. </P>

<P>Can’t See. You can’t see and automatically fail any ability check that requires sight. </P>

<P>Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage. </P>

<P>Blindsight </P>

<P>If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific </P>

<P>range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the Invisible condition. </P>

<P>Bloodied </P>

<P>A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points or fewer remaining. </P>

<P>Bonus Action </P>

<P>A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly says so. See also “Playing the Game” (“Actions”). </P>

<P>Breaking Objects </P>

<P>Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action. </P>

<P>Armor Class. The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances. </P>

<P>Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage. </P>

<P>Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. See also “Damage Threshold.” </P>

<P>No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws. </P>

<P>Bright Light </P>

<P>Bright Light is normal illumination. See also “Playing the Game” (“Exploration”). </P>

<P>Burning [Hazard] </P>

<P>A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you </P>

<P>can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself </P>

<P>the Prone condition and rolling on the ground. </P>

<P>The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or </P>

<P>suffocated. </P>

<P>Burrow Speed </P>

<P>A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the creature has a trait that allows it to do so. See also “Speed.” </P>

<P>Campaign </P>

<P>A campaign is a series of adventures. See also “Adventure.” </P>

<P>Cantrip </P>

<P>A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a spell slot. See also “Spells.” </P>

<P>Carrying Capacity </P>

<P>Your size and Strength score determine the maximum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push. </P>

<P>While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in excess of the maximum weight you can carry, your Speed can be no more than 5 feet. </P>

<P>Challenge Rating </P>

<P>Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a monster poses to a group of four player characters. Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using CR while planning potential combat encounters. See also “Stat Block.” </P>

<P>Character Sheet </P>

<P>A character sheet is a paper or digital record that you use to track your character’s information. See also “Character Creation.” </P>

<P>Charmed [Condition] </P>

<P>While you have the Charmed condition, you experience the following effects. </P>

<P>Can’t Harm the Charmer. You can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with damaging abilities or magical effects. </P>

<P>Social Advantage. The charmer has Advantage on any ability check to interact with you socially. </P>

<P>Climbing </P>

<P>While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs </P>

<P>1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You </P>

<P>ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and use it to climb. </P>

<P>At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. </P>

<P>Climb Speed </P>

<P>A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. See also “Climbing” and “Speed.” </P>

<P>Concentration </P>

<P>Some spells and other effects require Concentration </P>

<P>to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. </P>

<P>If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef</P>

<P>fect’s description specifies how long the creator can </P>

<P>concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration. </P>

<P>Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration. </P>

<P>Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30. </P>

<P>Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die. </P>

<P>Condition </P>

<P>A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, </P>

<P>and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions: </P>

<P>A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule. </P>

<P>Cone [Area of Effect] </P>

<P>A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point along its length that is 15 feet from the point of </P>

<P>origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its </P>

<P>maximum length. </P>

<P>A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise. </P>

<P>Cover </P>

<P>Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of </P>

<P>which provides a different benefit to a target: Half </P>

<P>Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”). </P>

<P>Crawling </P>

<P>While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs </P>

<P>1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). See also “Speed.” </P>

<P>Creature </P>

<P>Any being in the game, including a player’s character, is a creature. See also “Creature Type.” </P>

<P>Creature Type </P>

<P>Every creature, including every player character, has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game’s creature types: </P>

<P>The types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. </P>

<P>Critical Hit </P>

<P>If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of </P>

<P>any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets </P>

<P>you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers.See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”). </P>

<P>Cube [Area of Effect] </P>

<P>A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube spec</P>

<P>ifies its size, which is the length of each side. </P>

<P>A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise. </P>

<P>Curses </P>

<P>Some game effects curse a creature or an object. </P>

<P>The effect that confers a curse defines what the </P>

<P>curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove Curse and Greater Restoration spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses. </P>

<P>Cylinder [Area of Effect] </P>

<P>A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located at the center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder. The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the radius of the Cylinder’s base and the Cylinder’s height. </P>

<P>A Cylinder’s point of origin is included in the area of effect. </P>

<P>D20 Test </P>

<P>D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”). </P>

<P>Damage </P>

<P>Damage represents harm that causes a creature or an object to lose Hit Points. </P>

<P>Damage Roll </P>

<P>A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applica</P>

<P>ble modifiers, that deals damage to a target. See also </P>

<P>“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”). </P>

<P>Damage Threshold </P>

<P>A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the </P>

<P>damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce </P>

<P>Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage. </P>

<P>Damage Types </P>

<P>Attacks and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on the types. The Damage Types table offers examples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect. </P>

<P>Dash [Action] </P>

<P>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals </P>

<P>your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a </P>

<P>Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash. </P>

<P>If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your Speed when you take this action. You choose which speed to use each time you take it. See also “Speed.” </P>

<P>Dead </P>

<P>A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain </P>

<P>them unless it is first revived by magic such as the </P>

<P>Raise Dead or Revivify spell. When such a spell is cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the creature requires calling the spirit back. </P>

<P>If the creature returns to life, the revival effect determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses that were affecting it at death if the durations of those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more magic items, it is no longer attuned to them. </P>

<P>When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 Bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends. </P>

<P>A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave’s force, though, the creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the wall falls to the ground. </P>

If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. </P>

<P>Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. </P>

<P>Level 5 Evocation (Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a shard of glass) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes </P>

<P>An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or </P>

<P>vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating </P>

<P>or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up </P>

<P>to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up </P>

<P>of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). </P>

<P>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall. </P>

<P>Level 6 Evocation (Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a piece of quartz) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes </P>

<P>You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can </P>

<P>shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square </P>

<P>panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration. </P>

<P>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per 10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. </P>

<P>A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air </P>

<P>for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution </P>

<P>saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<H4>Wall of Stone </H4>

<P>Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a cube of granite) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes </P>

<P>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-footby-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. </P>

<P>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall. </P>

<P>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. </P>

<P>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like. </P>

<P>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion. </P>

<P>If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends. </P>

<H4>Wall of Thorns </H4>

<P>Level 6 Conjuration (Druid) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a handful of thorns) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes </P>

<P>You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. </P>

<P>When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. </P>

<P>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 6. </P>

While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. </P>

<P>The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. </P>

<H4>Water Breathing </H4>

<P>Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a short reed) Duration: 24 hours </P>

<P>This spell grants up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Water Walk </H4>

<P>Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action or Ritual Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a piece of cork) Duration: 1 hour </P>

<P>This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid </P>

<P>surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range gain this ability for the duration. </P>

<P>An affected target must take a Bonus Action to pass from the liquid’s surface into the liquid itself and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid, the target passes through the surface into the liquid below. </P>

<P>Web </P>

<P>Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour </P>

<P>You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point </P>

<P>within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the </P>

<P>area within them is Lightly Obscured. </P>

<P>If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. </P>

<P>The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free. </P>

<P>A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained. </P>

<P>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. </P>

<P>Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute </P>
</Sect>

<P>You try to create illusory terrors in others’ minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only. </P>

<H4>Wind Walk </H4>

<P>Level 6 Transmutation (Druid) </P>

<P>Casting Time: 1 minute Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a candle) Duration: 8 hours </P>

<P>You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action followed by a 1-minute transformation. </P>

<P>If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance. </P>

<H4>Wind Wall </H4>

<P>Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a fan and a feather) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute </P>

<P>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. </P>

<P>When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other </P>

<P>gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or </P>

<P>objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, light</P>

<P>weight materials brought into the wall fly upward. </P>

<P>Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles </P>

<P>launched at targets behind the wall are deflected </P>

<P>upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Wish </H4>

<P>Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: Self Components: V Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By </P>

<P>simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other </P>

<P>spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you </P>

<P>don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that </P>

<P>spell, including costly components. The spell simply </P>

<P>takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following </P>

<P>effects of your choice: </P>

<P>Object Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground. </P>

<P>Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell. </P>

<P>Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent. </P>

<P>Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. </P>

<P>Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features. </P>

<P>Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. </P>

<P>Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. </P>

<P>Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails. </P>

<P>The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a </P>

<P>spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 </P>

<P>Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress. </P>

<H4>Word of Recall </H4>

<P>Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 5 feet Components: V Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet </P>

<P>of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanc</P>

<P>tuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first </P>

<P>preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect. </P>

<P>You must designate a location, such as a temple, as a sanctuary by casting this spell there. </P>

<H4>Zone of Truth </H4>

<P>Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin) </P>

<P>Casting Time: Action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: 10 minutes </P>

<P>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature </P>

<P>that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a </P>

<P>turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save. </P>

<P>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful. </P>

<P>Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].” </P>

<Sect>
<P>A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family </P>
</Sect>

<P>of rules. The tags also have glossary entries. “You.” The game’s rules—in this glossary and else-where—often talk about something happening </P>

<Sect>
<P>to you in the game world. That “you” refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the “you” in the Prone condition is a creature that currently has that condition. </P>

<P>An adventure is a series of encounters. A story emerges through playing them. See also “Encounter.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Alignment </H4>

<P>A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of </P>

<P>two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or </P>

<P>neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors allow for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful Good and Neutral Evil. See also “Character Creation” (“Create Your Character”). </P>

<H4>Area of Effect </H4>

<P>The descriptions of many spells and other features specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de</P>

<P>fined elsewhere in this glossary: </P>

<P>Cone Cylinder Line Cube Emanation Sphere </P>

<P>An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn’t included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total Cover. See also “Cover.” </P>

<P>If the creator of an area of effect places it at an </P>

<P>unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall— </P>

<P>is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Armor Class </H4>

<P>An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an </P>

<P>attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a </P>

<P>target. </P>

</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Armor Training </H4>

<P>Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain category without the following drawbacks. If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also “Disadvantage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”). </P>

<P>Attack [Action] </P>

<P>When you take the Attack action, you can make one attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. </P>

<P>Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can either equip or unequip one weapon when you make an attack as part of this action. You do so either before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it. </P>

<P>Moving between Attacks. If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Attack Roll </H4>

<P>An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a spell. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”). </P>

<Part>
<H4>Blinded [Condition] </H4>

<P>While you have the Blinded condition, you experience the following effects. </P>

<P>Can’t See. You can’t see and automatically fail any ability check that requires sight. </P>

<P>Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage. </P>

<H4>Bloodied </H4>

<P>A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points or fewer remaining. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Bonus Action </H4>

</Table>

<P>Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The GM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse. </P>

<P>Object Hit Points Size Fragile Resilient </P>

<P>Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) </P>

<P>Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6) </P>

<P>Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) </P>

<P>Large (cart, dining table) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10) </P>

<P>Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage. </P>

<P>Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. See also “Damage Threshold.” </P>

<P>No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws. </P>

<H4>Challenge Rating </H4>

<P>Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a monster poses to a group of four player characters. Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using CR while planning potential combat encounters. See also “Stat Block.” </P>

<P>ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and use it to climb. </P>
</Part>
<Part>
<H4>Climb Speed </H4>

<P>A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. See also “Climbing” and “Speed.” </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Concentration </H4>

<P>Some spells and other effects require Concentration </P>

<P>to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. </P>

<P>If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef</P>

<P>fect’s description specifies how long the creator can </P>

<P>concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration. </P>

<P>Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration. </P>

<P>Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30. </P>

<P>Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die. </P>

<H4>Damage Threshold </H4>

<P>A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the </P>

<P>damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce </P>

<P>Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage. </P>
</Part>

<P>If the creature returns to life, the revival effect determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses that were affecting it at death if the durations of those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more magic items, it is no longer attuned to them. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Illusions </H4>

<P>Spells and other effects sometimes create magical il</P>

<P>lusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does </P>

<P>and which senses or mental faculties it deceives. </P>

<P>If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be affected by the environment as if the illusion were real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible illusion echoes in an echoey space. </P>

<H4>Improvised Weapons </H4>

<P>An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below. </P>

<P>Proficiency. Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to </P>

<P>attack rolls with an improvised weapon. </P>

<P>Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object. </P>

<P>Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. </P>

<P>Weapon Equivalents. If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon’s rules. For example, the GM could treat a table leg as a Club. </P>

<H4>Indifferent [Attitude] </H4>

<P>An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hinder you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a monster. See also “Influence.” </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Influence [Action] </H4>

<P>With the Influence action, you urge a monster to </P>

<P>do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The GM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below. </P>

<P>Willing. If your urging aligns with the monster’s desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers. </P>

<P>Unwilling. If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn’t comply. </P>

<P>Hesitant. If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the same way again. </P>

<H4>Initiative </H4>

<P>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in “Playing the Game” explain how to roll Initiative. </P>

<P>Sometimes a GM might have combatants use their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If you have Advantage on Initiative rolls, increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Disadvantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”). </P>

</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Knocking Out a Creature </H4>

<P>When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest. </P>

<P>The creature remains Unconscious until it regains any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. </P>
</Part>

<H4>Line [Area of Effect] </H4>

<P>A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point of origin in a straight path along its length and covers an area defined by its width. The effect that creates a Line specifies its length and width. </P>

<P>A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise. </P>
</Part>

<H4>Long Jump </H4>

<P>When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement. </P>

<P>If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the Prone condition. </P>

<P>This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle. </P>

<P>Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature’s general awareness of its surroundings. The GM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom (Perception) check. </P>

<P>A creature’s Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the creature has Advantage on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 + 2).

See also “Opportunity Attacks” and “Playing the Game” (“Actions”). </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Ready [Action] </H4>

<P>You take the Ready action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a Reaction before the start of your next turn. </P>

<P>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your Speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the zombie steps next to me, I move away.” </P>

<P>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. </P>

<P>When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your Reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell’s magic requires Concentration, which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. </P>

<H4>Speed </H4>

<P>A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. See also “Climbing,” “Crawling,” “Flying,” “Jumping,” “Swimming” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”). </P>

<P>Special Speeds. Some creatures have special speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, choose which one to use when you move; you can switch between the speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more. </P>

<P>Changes to Your Speeds. If an effect increases or decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly Speed is also halved. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Telepathy </H4>

<P>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. Unless a rule states otherwise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the telepath to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself to understand. </P>

<P>A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken if either the telepath or the other creature has the Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also broken if the contacted creature is no longer within the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a different creature within range. </P>

<P>A creature without telepathy can receive telepathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic conversation. Once a telepathic conversation starts, the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the telepath until the telepathic connection ends. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Teleportation </H4>

<P>Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear elsewhere instantly, without moving through the intervening space. This transportation doesn’t expend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise, and teleportation never provokes Opportunity Attacks. </P>

<P>When you teleport, all the equipment you’re wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re touching another creature when you teleport, that creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the teleportation effect says otherwise. </P>

<P>If the destination space of your teleportation is occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice. </P>

<P>The description of a teleportation effect tells you if you must see the teleportation’s destination. </P>

<H4>Unarmed Strike </H4>

<P>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed </P>

<P>Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your </P>

<P>body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you. </P>

<P>Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect. </P>

<P>Damage. You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier. </P>

<P>Grapple. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it. See also “Grappling.” </P>

<P>Shove. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you. </P>
</Part>

<H2>Travel Pace </H2>

<P>A group of characters can travel overland at a Normal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a group’s travel pace. </P>

<P>The group must move at a Slow pace if any group member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Extended Travel </H3>

<P>Characters can push themselves to travel for more than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, each character must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours. </P>

<H3>Special Movement </H3>

<P>If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended time, as with a spell such as Wind Walk or a magic item such as a Carpet of Flying, translate the party’s Speed into travel rates using these rules: </P>
</Sect>

<P>Travel Terrain Terrain Maximum Pace Encounter Distance </P>

<Sect>
<P>Miles per hour = Speed 10 Miles per day (Normal pace) = Miles per hour × number of hours traveled (typically 8) Fast pace = Miles per day × 1⅓ (round down) Slow pace = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down) </P>

<P>If the characters are flying or their special movement allows them to ignore Difficult Terrain, they </P>

<P>can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<H2>Creating a Background </H2>

<P>A character’s background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating a unique background or customizing an existing one can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create a background to help a player craft the story they have in mind for their character. </P>

<P>This section describes, step by step, how you can create backgrounds tailored for your world and the heroes in it. </P>
</Sect>

<H2>Curses and Magical Contagions </H2>

<P>A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified </P>

<P>time or until it is ended by some means. A magical contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that </P>

<P>is contagious by definition. </P>

<P>The following sections discuss curses and magical contagions in detail. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Curses </H3>

<P>A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed below. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Bestow Curse </H4>

<P>The simplest curses are created by the Bestow Curse spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can be ended by the Remove Curse spell. </P>

<P>Bestow Curse provides useful benchmarks for gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9 spell. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Cursed Creatures </H4>

<P>Some monsters are associated with curses, whether as part of their origins or due to their ability to spread curses—werewolves being a prime example. </P>

<P>You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects a creature with accursed origins. For example, you might decide that a mummy was created through a curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by casting Remove Curse on its corpse. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Cursed Magic Items </H4>

<P>Cursed magic items are created deliberately or originate as the result of supernatural events. Such items are detailed in “Magic Items.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Narrative Curses </H4>

<P>A curse might manifest during an adventure when a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernat</P>

<P>ural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a </P>

<P>tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can have any effects you design, or it might be a customized version of another type of curse discussed in this section. </P>

<P>A creature affected by such a curse should know why they’re being punished and be able to learn how to end their curse, likely by symbolically righting the wrong they committed. How a spell like Remove Curse affects a curse that’s part of your adventure is up to you—the spell might merely suppress the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless, narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic rooted in the lore of your campaign. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Environmental Curses </H4>

<P>Some locations are so suffused with evil that anyone who lingers there is burdened with a curse. Demonic Possession is one example of an environmental curse. </P>

<P>Demonic Possession. Demonic Possession arises from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly besets creatures that interact with demonic objects or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic spirits await victims. </P>

<P>A creature that becomes the target of Demonic Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of the creature and determines the creature’s behavior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself on a success. </P>

<P>After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with Demonic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. A Dispel Evil and Good spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect on it. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Magical Contagions </H3>

<P>Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic are credited with creating the first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form the basis of an adventure as characters search for a cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Rest and Recuperation </H4>

<P>If a creature infected with a magical contagion spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no </P>

<P>activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the </P>

<P>creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has Advantage on saving </P>

<P>throws to fight off the magical contagion for the </P>

<P>next 24 hours. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Example Contagions </H4>

<P>The following examples show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to suit your campaign. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Cackle Fever </H4>

<P>Magical Contagion </P>

<P>Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection: </P>

<P>Fever. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the creature. Uncontrollable Laughter. While the creature has </P>

<P>the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes </P>

<P>a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it </P>

<P>takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a </P>

<P>failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic </P>

<P>damage and has the Incapacitated condition as </P>

<P>it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its </P>

<P>turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the </P>

<P>effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it suc</P>

<P>ceeds automatically. </P>

<P>Fighting the Contagion. At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year. </P>

<P>Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot Emanation originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Sewer Plague </H4>

<P>Magical Contagion </P>

<P>Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes </P>

<P>into contact with contaminated filth or offal must </P>

<P>succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection: </P>

<P>Fatigue. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level. </P>

<P>Weakness. While the creature has any Exhaustion </P>

<P>levels, it regains only half the normal number of </P>

<P>Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice. Restlessness. While the creature has any Exhaus</P>

<P>tion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores </P>

<P>lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaus</P>

<P>tion level. </P>

<P>Fighting the Contagion. Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Sight Rot </H4>

<P>Magical Contagion </P>

<P>Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the contagion ends. </P>

<P>Fighting the Contagion. Magic such as a Heal or Lesser Restoration spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature. </P>

<P>Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours. </P>

<H2>Environmental Effects </H2>

<Sect>
<H3>Deep Water </H3>

<P>Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Extreme Cold </H3>

<P>When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Extreme Heat </H3>

<P>When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour </P>

<P>or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first </P>

<P>hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Frigid Water </H3>

<P>A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Heavy Precipitation </H3>

<P>Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy </P>

<P>snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the </P>

<P>area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) </P>

<P>checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>High Altitude </H3>

<P>Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”). </P>

<P>Creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Slippery Ice </H3>

<P>Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn </P>

<P>or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Strong Wind </H3>

<P>Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open </P>

<P>flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a </P>

<P>strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall. </P>

<P>A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Thin Ice </H3>

<P>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid Water” above). </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Fear and Mental Stress </H2>

<P>Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress </P>

<P>than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in </P>

<P>terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of even the most stalwart adventurer. </P>

<P>If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them with your players at the start of the campaign. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Fear Effects </H3>

<P>Whenever the characters encounter something that is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened condition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample Fear DCs table provides some examples. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Sample Fear DCs Example Save DC </H5>

<P>When the characters open a sarcophagus, a 10 harmless yet terrifying apparition appears. </P>

<P>A character triggers a magical trap that 15 creates an illusory manifestation of that character’s worst fears, visible only to that character. </P>

<P>A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a 20 nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter. </P>

<P>Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. </P>

<P>At your discretion, a Frightened creature might be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened condition lasts. Consider these examples: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>The Frightened creature must take the Dash action on each of its turns and uses its movement to get farther away from the source of its fear. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage. </LBody>
</LI>

<LBody>The Frightened creature can do only one of the following on each of its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action. </LBody>
</LI>

</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Mental Stress Effects </H3>

<P>When a character is subjected to an effect that causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the best way to emulate that effect. </P>

<P>The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a few examples of such effects, with suggested saving throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more appropriate. On a successful save, a character might take half as much damage instead of no damage, at your discretion. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Sample Mental Stress Effects </H5>

<P>Save Psychic Example DC Damage </P>

<P>A character ingests a hallucinogenic 10 1d6 substance that distorts the character’s perception of reality. </P>

<P>A character touches a fiendish idol 15 3d6 that tears at the character’s mind, threatening to shatter it. </P>

<P>A magical trap flings a character into 20 9d6 the Far Realm until the end of that character’s next turn. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Prolonged Effects </H4>

<P>Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged effects. Consider the following possibilities. </P>

<P>Short-Term Effects. The character has the Frightened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10 minutes. This condition might be accompanied by alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or removed by the Lesser Restoration spell. </P>

<P>Long-Term Effects. The character has Disadvantage on some or all ability checks for 1d10 × 10 hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability to exert a particular set of abilities. The character might feel enervated and unable to exert much Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of others that Charisma checks are more difficult. These effects can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or removed by the Lesser Restoration spell. </P>

<P>Indefinite Effects. An indefinite effect is a longterm effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a Greater Restoration spell. It can be suppressed by a Calm Emotions spell. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Poison </H2>

<P>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are </P>

<P>a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types: </P>

<P>Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects. </P>

<P>Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half as much damage on a failed save. </P>

<P>Inhaled. Poisonous powders and gases take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. </P>

<P>Injury. Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects. </P>

<H3>Purchasing Poison </H3>

<P>In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison they seek. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Harvesting Poison </H3>

<P>A character can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature’s poison. </P>

<H2>Traps </H2>

<P>Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too many traps in an adventure can lead players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game. </P>

<P>The best traps are fleeting distractions that skilled characters can overcome in a short amount of time or deadly puzzles that require quick thinking and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are undetectable and inescapable are rarely fun. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Parts of a Trap </H3>

<P>The description of a trap includes the following parts after the trap’s name: </P>

<P>Severity and Levels. A trap is designated as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels. A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly trap can grievously damage characters of the indicated levels. </P>

<P>Trigger. Traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Examples of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using the wrong key in a lock. </P>

<P>Duration. Some traps have durations expressed in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that their effects last until the trap is destroyed or dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is otherwise inert after activation. </P>

<P>Use caution when introducing a trap to characters of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly to characters of a lower level range. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Collapsing Roof </H4>

<P>Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two weak supports that topple when the trip wire is pulled. </P>

<P>The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the supports to topple and the unstable section of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns </P>

<P>the trapped area into Difficult Terrain.  </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required). </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table. </P>

<P>Levels Bludgeoning Damage Save DC </P>

<P>5–10 22 (4d10) 15 </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Falling Net </H4>

<P>Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. </P>

<P>The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the Net to fall on it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it’s Huge or larger. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the Net on a successful check.  </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required). </P>

<P>Destroy the Net. Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring Gear” for the Net’s statistics). </P>

<P>Set the Trap. A creature that has Thieves’ Tools and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes. </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength (Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC 14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20. </P>

<H4>Fire-Casting Statue </H4>

<P>Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate </P>

<P>Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the start of the next turn </P>

<P>When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure </P>

<P>plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn </P>

<P>there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of </P>

<P>magical flame. The statue can look like anything, </P>

<P>such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. A Detect Magic spell reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a successful check. Once the glyph is found, a character can take a Study action to examine it and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that the glyph means “fire” on a successful check. As an action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the glyph, which disarms the trap. </P>

<P>As a Search action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the area of effect, as shown in the following table. </P>

<P>Levels Fire Damage Area of Effect </P>

<P>5–10 22 (4d10) 30-foot Cone </P>

<P>This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed </P>

<P>from material identical to the surrounding floor. </P>

<P>When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit. The lid remains open thereafter. </P>

<P>A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage from the fall. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pit’s lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be held shut using Arcane Lock or similar magic. </P>

<P>Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing gear, or magic such as Spider Climb to scale the pit’s smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as handholds and footholds. </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as shown in the following table. </P>

<P>Levels Pit Depth Bludgeoning Damage </P>

<P>5–10 30 feet 10 (3d6) </P>

<P>start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than </P>

<P>three times </P>

<P>When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure </P>

<P>plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts </P>

<P>shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes. </P>

<P>Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3 darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, or detritus prevents the darts from firing. </P>

<P>As a Search action, a creature can examine the </P>

<P>section of floor that forms the pressure plate and </P>

<P>make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels 11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20. </P>

<H4>Rolling Stone </H4>

<P>Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels 17–20) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate Duration: Until the stone stops rolling </P>

<P>When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll. </P>

<P>On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if redirected by an obstacle. The stone can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through the stone’s space, treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn or a creature enters the stone’s space while the stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. </P>

<P>The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into nearby passages that allow the stone to keep moving. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature </P>

<P>can examine the section of floor that forms the </P>

<P>pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. </P>

<P>Destroy the Stone. The stone is a Large object that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. </P>

<P>Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat. </P>

<H3>Combat Encounter Difficulty </H3>

<P>Use the following guidelines to create a combat en</P>

<P>counter of a desired level of difficulty. </P>

<P>Step 1: Choose a Difficulty </P>

<P>Three categories describe the range of encounter </P>

<P>difficulty: </P>

<P>Low Difficulty. An encounter of low difficulty is likely to have one or two scary moments for the players, but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources, however. As a rough guideline, a single monster generally presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of four characters whose level equals the monster’s Challenge Rating. </P>

<P>Moderate Difficulty. Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die. </P>

<P>High Difficulty. A high-difficulty encounter could be lethal for one or more characters. To survive it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick thinking, and maybe even a little luck. </P>

<P>Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget </P>

<P>Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-reference the party’s level with the desired encounter </P>

<P>difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the </P>

<P>number of characters in the party to get your XP budget for the encounter. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>———Encounter Difficulty ——— </H5>

<P>Party’s Level Low Moderate High </P>

<P>20 6,400 13,200 22,000 </P>

<P>Step 3: Spend Your Budget </P>

<P>Every creature has an XP value in its stat block. When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples are given below: </P>

<P>Example 1. A low-difficulty encounter for four level </P>

<P>1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the following encounters: </P>

<P>Example 2. A moderate-difficulty encounter for five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, </P>

<P>for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build either of these encounters: </P>

<H3>Troubleshooting </H3>

<P>When creating and running combat encounters, keep the following in mind. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Many Creatures </H4>

<P>The more creatures in an encounter, the higher the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Adjustments </H4>

<P>A player’s absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended </P>

<P>difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result </P>

<P>in an encounter being easier or harder than in</P>

<P>tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the encounter </P>

<P>Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, use swarms instead. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Number of Stat Blocks </H4>

<P>The best combat encounters often pair one kind of </P>

<P>creature with another, such as fire giants paired </P>

<P>with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Powerful Creatures </H4>

<P>If your combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an Ogre (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single blow. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Unusual Features </H4>

<P>If a monster has a feature that lower-level characters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that monster to an encounter for characters whose level is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating. </P>

<H1>Magic Items </H1>

<P>Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Magic Item Categories </H2>

<P>Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic Item Categories table lists the nine categories and provides examples. Rules for the categories appear after the table. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Magic Item Categories Category Examples </H5>

<P>Armor +1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield </P>

<P>Potions Potion of Healing </P>

<P>Rings Ring of Invisibility </P>

<P>Rods Immovable Rod </P>

<P>Scrolls Spell Scroll </P>

<P>Staffs Staff of Striking </P>

<P>Wands Wand of Fireballs </P>

<P>Weapons +1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword </P>

<P>Wondrous Items Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind </P>

<P>Armor </P>

<P>An item in the Armor category is typically a magical version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an armor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must be worn for its magic to function. </P>

<P>Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it randomly. </P>

<P>Potions </P>

<P>An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial. </P>

<P>Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up. </P>

<P>Mixing Potions. A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions. </P>

<P>When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident. </P>

<P>loses its effect. 36–90 Both potions work normally. 91–99 Both potions work, but the numerical effects </P>

<P>and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. </P>

<P>00 Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might give the drinker the Invisible condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell or similar magic might end this lasting effect. </P>

<P>Rings </P>

<P>For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise. </P>

<P>Rods </P>

<P>An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds. </P>

<P>Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus. </P>

<P>Scrolls </P>

<P>An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form. </P>

<P>Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust. </P>

<P>Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise. </P>

<P>Staffs </P>

<P>Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane. </P>

<P>Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus. </P>

<P>Wands </P>

<P>An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material. </P>

<P>Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus. </P>

<P>Weapons </P>

<P>A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no </P>

<P>weapon type is specified, you may choose the type </P>

<P>or determine it randomly. </P>

<P>Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not. </P>

<P>Wondrous Items </P>

<P>Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and </P>

<P>circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical </P>

<P>instruments, and more also fall into this category. </P>

<P>MAGIC ITEM RULES </P>

<P>Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are presented below. </P>

<P>Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has </P>

<P>a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of </P>

<P>that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be </P>

<P>a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual</P>

<P>ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or </P>

<P>features, not by using a magic item or the like. </P>

<P>Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic </P>

<P>items that are meant to be worn tend to magically </P>

<P>adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can </P>

<P>decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit </P>

<P>any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might make items usable only by folk who are sized and shaped like dwarves. </P>

<P>Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide </P>

<P>whether a creature can wear an item not made for </P>

<P>its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, </P>

<P>but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t </P>

<P>wear magic boots. </P>

<P>Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the </P>

<P>rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex</P>

<P>ample, a character with only one arm might be able </P>

<P>to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the </P>

<P>matching glove is on their person. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Magic Item Rarity </H2>

<P>Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a </P>

<P>rough measure of an item’s power relative to other </P>

<P>magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic </P>

<P>Item Rarities and Values table. Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing, </P>

<P>are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon </P>

<P>Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire. </P>

<P>Magic Item Values by Rarity </P>

<P>Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment. </P>

<P>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic item’s value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate Armor (1,500 GP). </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Activating a Magic Item </H2>

<P>It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item’s user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. </P>

<P>Command Word </P>

<P>A command word is a word or short phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the Silence spell. </P>

<P>Consumable Items </P>

<P>Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. </P>

<P>Spells Cast from Items </P>

<P>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. </P>

<P>A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, </P>

<P>their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies. </P>

<P>Charges </P>

<P>Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>“The Next Dawn” </H2>

<P>Magic items often have charges or properties that </P>

<P>recharge at the next dawn or some other specified </P>

<P>time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis</P>

<P>tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the </P>

<P>GM determines when the item recharges. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Cursed Items </H2>

<P>A magic item’s description specifies whether it </P>

<P>bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse. </P>

<P>Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a Remove Curse spell. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Magic Item Resilience </H2>

<P>A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage. </P>

<P>An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires research or the completion of a quest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Crafting Magic Items </H2>

<P>“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, “you” refers to the character crafting the magic item. </P>

<P>Arcana Proficiency </P>

<P>To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must </P>

<P>have proficiency in the Arcana skill. </P>

<P>Tools </P>

<P>The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the required tool to make an item and </P>

<P>have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information </P>

<P>on the tools, see “Equipment.” </P>

<P>Magic Item Tools Item Category Required Tool </P>

<P>Armor Leatherworker’s Tools, Smith’s Tools, or Weaver’s Tools depending on the kind of armor as noted in the tools’ descriptions </P>

<P>Potion Alchemist’s Supplies or Herbalism Kit </P>

<P>Ring Jeweler’s Tools </P>

<P>Rod Woodcarver’s Tools </P>

<P>Scroll Calligrapher’s Supplies </P>

<P>Staff Woodcarver’s Tools </P>

<P>Wand Woodcarver’s Tools </P>

<P>Weapon Leatherworker’s Tools, Smith’s Tools, or Woodcarver’s Tools depending on the kind of weapon as noted in the tools’ descriptions </P>

<P>Wondrous Item Tinker’s Tools or the tool required to make the nonmagical item on which the magic item is based </P>

<P>Spells </P>

<P>If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item. </P>

<P>Time and Cost </P>

<P>Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. </P>

<P>Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive. </P>

<P>Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants. </P>

<P>Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again. </P>

<P>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor. </P>

<P>Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost Item Rarity Time* Cost* </P>

<P>Common 5 days 50 GP </P>

<P>Uncommon 10 days 200 GP </P>

<P>Rare 50 days 2,000 GP </P>

<P>Very Rare 125 days 20,000 GP </P>

<P>Legendary 250 days 100,000 GP </P>

<P>*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll, whose crafting time and cost are given in “Equipment.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Sentient Magic Items </H2>

<P>Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side. </P>

<P>Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. </P>

<P>The GM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see “Conflict” below). </P>

<P>Sentient Magic Item Traits </P>

<P>When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item’s persona much as you would create an NPC, with these exceptions. </P>

<P>Abilities </P>

<P>A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. </P>

<P>Alignment </P>

<P>A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s Alignment table. </P>

<P>Communication </P>

<P>A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication table. </P>

<P>Senses </P>

<P>A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the Sentient Item’s Senses table. </P>

<P>Special Purpose </P>

<P>You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating </P>

<P>from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can </P>

<P>pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s Special Purpose table. </P>

<P>9 Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar to itself. </P>

<P>10 Templar. The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity. </P>

<P>Conflict </P>

<P>When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner </P>

<P>opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s </P>

<P>bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus </P>

<P>the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the </P>

<P>item makes one or more of the following demands: </P>

<P>Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. </P>

<P>Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis</P>

<P>pose of anything the item finds repugnant. </P>

<P>It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be given to someone else. </P>

<P>Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or worn at all times. </P>

<P>If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s demands, the item can do any of the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Suppress one or more of its activated properties. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for 1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item’s commands. If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn. </P>

<H2>Magic Items A–Z </H2>

<P>Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. </P>

<P>If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s name and presents it in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to the creature’s stat block. Unless the text states otherwise, the stat block is in “Monsters.” How to read and use a stat block is explained in “Monsters.” </P>

<P>Adamantine Armor </P>

<P>Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), Uncommon </P>

<P>This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit. </P>

<P>Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3 </P>

<P>Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very Rare (+3) </P>

<P>You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical. </P>

<P>This ammunition is typically found or sold in quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of the same rarity. </P>

<P>Ammunition of Slaying </P>

<P>Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare </P>

<P>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical. </P>

<P>Animated Shield </P>

<P>Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>While holding this Shield, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take a Bonus Action to end this effect, or until you die or have the Incapacitated condition, at which point the Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free. </P>

<P>Apparatus of the Crab </P>

<P>Wondrous Item, Legendary </P>

<P>This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel </P>

<P>weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. </P>

<P>The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. </P>

<P>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. </P>

<P>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure. </P>

<P>A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Leverstable. </P>

<H4>Rolling Stone </H4>

<P>Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels 17–20) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate Duration: Until the stone stops rolling </P>

<P>When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll. </P>

<P>On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if redirected by an obstacle. The stone can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through the stone’s space, treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn or a creature enters the stone’s space while the stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. </P>

<P>The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into nearby passages that allow the stone to keep moving. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature </P>

<P>pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. </P>

<P>Destroy the Stone. The stone is a Large object that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. </P>

<P>Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat. </P>

<H4>Spiked Pit </H4>

<P>Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4) </P>

<P>Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid Duration: Instantaneous </P>

<P>A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from </P>

<P>material identical to the surrounding floor. When </P>

<P>a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit, which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the bottom. The lid remains open thereafter. </P>

<P>A creature that falls into the pit lands at the bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from the spikes. </P>

<P>Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature </P>

<P>can examine the section of floor that forms the pit’s </P>

<P>lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the </P>

<P>surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, </P>

<P>thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be held shut using an Arcane Lock spell or similar magic. </P>

<P>Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing gear, or magic such as a Spider Climb spell to scale the pit’s smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as handholds and footholds. </P>

<P>At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as shown in the following table. </P>

<H5>Combat Encounters XP Budget per Character </H5>

<Sect>
<P>The following features can make a combat encounter more interesting or challenging: </P>

<P>Changes in Elevation. Terrain features that provide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever positioning and encourage characters to jump, climb, fly, or teleport. </P>

<P>Defensive Positions. Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions force characters who normally attack at range to move around. </P>

<P>Mixed Monster Groups. When different types of monsters work together, they can combine their abilities—just like characters with different classes and origins. A diverse force is more powerful. </P>

<P>Reasons to Move. Use features that encourage characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and rolling stone traps. </P>

<H3>Combat Encounter Difficulty </H3>

<P>Use the following guidelines to create a combat en</P>

<P>counter of a desired level of difficulty. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Step 1: Choose a Difficulty </H4>

<P>Three categories describe the range of encounter </P>

<P>difficulty: </P>

<P>Low Difficulty. An encounter of low difficulty is likely to have one or two scary moments for the players, but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources, however. As a rough guideline, a single monster generally presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of four characters whose level equals the monster’s Challenge Rating. </P>

<P>Moderate Difficulty. Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die. </P>

<P>High Difficulty. A high-difficulty encounter could be lethal for one or more characters. To survive it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick thinking, and maybe even a little luck. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget </H4>

<P>Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-reference the party’s level with the desired encounter </P>

<P>difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the </P>

<P>number of characters in the party to get your XP budget for the encounter. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>———Encounter Difficulty ——— </H5>

<P>Party’s Level Low Moderate High </P>

<P>1 50 75 100 </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Step 3: Spend Your Budget </H4>

<P>Every creature has an XP value in its stat block. When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples are given below: </P>

<P>Example 1. A low-difficulty encounter for four level </P>

<Sect>
<P>1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the following encounters: </P>
</Sect>

<LBody>6 Giant Rats (25 XP each), for 150 XP total </LBody>

<P>Example 2. A moderate-difficulty encounter for five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, </P>

<Sect>
<P>for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build either of these encounters: </P>
</Sect>

</Sect>
</Part>
<Part>
<H3>Troubleshooting </H3>

<P>When creating and running combat encounters, keep the following in mind. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Many Creatures </H4>

<P>The more creatures in an encounter, the higher the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Adjustments </H4>

<P>A player’s absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended </P>

<P>difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result </P>

<P>in an encounter being easier or harder than in</P>

<P>tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the encounter </P>

<P>easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter harder). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>CR 0 Creatures </H4>

<P>Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, use swarms instead. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Number of Stat Blocks </H4>

<P>The best combat encounters often pair one kind of </P>

<P>creature with another, such as fire giants paired </P>

<P>with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Powerful Creatures </H4>

<P>If your combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an Ogre (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single blow. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Unusual Features </H4>

<P>If a monster has a feature that lower-level characters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that monster to an encounter for characters whose level is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating. </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<Sect>
<H1>Magic Items </H1>

<P>Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways. </P>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H3>Potions </H3>

<P>An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial. </P>

<P>Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up. </P>

<P>Mixing Potions. A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions. </P>
</Sect>

<P>When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident. </P>

<H3>Scrolls </H3>

<P>An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form. </P>

<P>Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust. </P>

<P>Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise. </P>

<H3>Staffs </H3>

<P>Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane. </P>

<P>Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Wands </H3>

<P>An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material. </P>

<P>Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Weapons </H3>

<P>A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no </P>

<P>weapon type is specified, you may choose the type </P>

<P>or determine it randomly. </P>

<P>Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not. </P>

<P>instruments, and more also fall into this category. </P>

<Sect>
<P>MAGIC ITEM RULES </P>

<P>Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are presented below. </P>

<P>Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has </P>

<P>a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of </P>

<P>that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be </P>

<P>a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual</P>

<P>ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or </P>

<P>features, not by using a magic item or the like. </P>

<P>Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic </P>

<P>items that are meant to be worn tend to magically </P>

<P>adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can </P>

<P>decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit </P>

<P>any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might make items usable only by folk who are sized and shaped like dwarves. </P>

<P>Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide </P>

<P>whether a creature can wear an item not made for </P>

<P>its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, </P>

<P>but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t </P>

<P>wear magic boots. </P>

<P>Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the </P>

<P>rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex</P>

<P>ample, a character with only one arm might be able </P>

<P>to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the </P>

<P>matching glove is on their person. </P>

<H2>Magic Item Rarity </H2>

<P>Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a </P>

<P>rough measure of an item’s power relative to other </P>

<P>magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic </P>

<P>Item Rarities and Values table. Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing, </P>

<P>are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon </P>

<P>Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Magic Item Values by Rarity </H3>

<P>Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment. </P>

<P>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic item’s value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate Armor (1,500 GP). </P>

<Part>
<H2>Activating a Magic Item </H2>

<P>It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item’s user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Command Word </H3>

<P>A command word is a word or short phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the Silence spell. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Consumable Items </H3>

<P>Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Spells Cast from Items </H4>

<P>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. </P>

<P>A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, </P>

<P>their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Charges </H4>

<P>Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>“The Next Dawn” </H2>

<P>Magic items often have charges or properties that </P>

<P>recharge at the next dawn or some other specified </P>

<P>time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis</P>

<P>tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the </P>

<P>GM determines when the item recharges. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Cursed Items </H2>

<P>A magic item’s description specifies whether it </P>

<P>bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse. </P>

<P>Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a Remove Curse spell. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Magic Item Resilience </H2>

<P>A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage. </P>

<P>An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires research or the completion of a quest. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Crafting Magic Items </H2>

<P>“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, “you” refers to the character crafting the magic item. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Arcana Proficiency </H3>

<P>To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must </P>

<P>have proficiency in the Arcana skill. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Tools </H3>

<P>The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the required tool to make an item and </P>

<P>have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information </P>

<P>on the tools, see “Equipment.” </P>
</Sect>
</Part>
<Part>
<H3>Spells </H3>

<P>If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H3>Time and Cost </H3>

<P>Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. </P>

<P>Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive. </P>

<P>Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants. </P>

<P>Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again. </P>

<P>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost Item Rarity Time* Cost* </H5>

<P>Common 5 days 50 GP </P>

<P>Uncommon 10 days 200 GP </P>

<P>Rare 50 days 2,000 GP </P>

<P>Very Rare 125 days 20,000 GP </P>

<P>Legendary 250 days 100,000 GP </P>

<P>*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll, whose crafting time and cost are given in “Equipment.” </P>
</Sect>
</Part>

<Part>
<H2>Sentient Magic Items </H2>

<P>Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side. </P>

<P>Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. </P>

<P>The GM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see “Conflict” below). </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Sentient Magic Item Traits </H3>

<P>When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item’s persona much as you would create an NPC, with these exceptions. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Abilities </H4>

<P>A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Alignment </H4>

<P>A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s Alignment table. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Communication </H4>

<P>A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication table. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Senses </H4>

<P>A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the Sentient Item’s Senses table. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Special Purpose </H4>

<P>You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating </P>

<P>from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can </P>

<P>pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s Special Purpose table. </P>

<H4>Conflict </H4>

<P>When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner </P>

<P>opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s </P>

<P>bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus </P>

<P>the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the </P>

<P>item makes one or more of the following demands: </P>

<P>Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. </P>

<P>Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis</P>

<P>pose of anything the item finds repugnant. </P>

<P>It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be given to someone else. </P>

<P>Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or worn at all times. </P>

<P>If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s demands, the item can do any of the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Suppress one or more of its activated properties. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for 1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item’s commands. If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn. </P>

<H4>Apparatus of the Crab </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Legendary </P>

<P>This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel </P>

<P>weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. </P>

<P>The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. </P>

<P>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. </P>

<P>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure. </P>

<P>A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Leverstable. </P>

<H4>Bag of Beans </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare </P>

<P>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans. </P>
</Sect>

<P>If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

<P>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly. </P>

<H4>Bag of Devouring </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Very Rare </P>

<P>This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding </P>

<P>orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. </P>

<P>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed. </P>

<P>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane. </P>

<P>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane. </P>
</Part>

<Part>
<H4>Bag of Holding </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon </P>

<P>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action. </P>

<P>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. </P>

<P>Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened. </P>

<H4>Bag of Tricks </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon </P>

<P>This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling on the table that corresponds to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. </P>

<P>The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative count. You can take a Bonus Action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. </P>

<P>Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can pass through. </P>

<P>An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside. </P>

<H4>Deck of Illusions </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon </P>

<P>a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usu</P>

<P>ally missing 1d20 − 1 cards. </P>

<P>The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card. </P>

<P>Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again. </P>

<P>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. </P>

<P>While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it. </P>

<P>While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides. </P>

<P>Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. </P>

<P>Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour. </P>

<P>water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats </P>

<P>or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic. </P>

<P>As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. </P>

One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat </P>

<P>reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, </P>

<P>any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat </P>

<P>reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature </P>

<P>repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to </P>

<P>this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine </P>

<P>has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed. </P>

<P>Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a </P>

<P>figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have </P>

<P>passed, when it regains all expended charges. </P>

<P>Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed. </P>

<P>The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time </P>

<P>you use it to ignore your orders, including a com</P>

<P>mand to revert to figurine form. If you mount the </P>

<P>nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the </P>

<P>nightmare reverts to figurine form. </P>

<H4>Handy Haversack </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare </P>

<P>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. </P>

<P>Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. </P>

<P>If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.

The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. </P>

<H4>Instant Fortress </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower. </P>

<P>The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the Knock spell and similar magic. </P>

<P>Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points. </P>

<H4>Ioun Stone </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. </P>

<P>When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time. </P>

<P>Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it. </P>

<P>As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it’s orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it. </P>

<P>The type of stone determines its rarity and effects. </P>

<P>Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. </P>

<P>Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head. </P>

<P>Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. </P>

<P>Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head. </P>

<P>Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit Point. </P>

<P>Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM. </P>

<P>Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. </P>

<P>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space. </P>

<P>Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head. </P>

<P>Sustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head. </P>

<H4>Iron Bands </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare </P>

<P>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands. </P>

<P>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more. </P>

<P>A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. </P>

<P>Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<P>you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask </P>

<P>is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be </P>

<P>trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and </P>

<P>doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink. </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn’t know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. </P>

<P>An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the GM. </P>

Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 Psychic damage. </P>

<P>To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies. </P>

<H4>Marvelous Pigments </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Very Rare </P>

<P>This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment </P>

<P>and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). </P>

<P>Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted. </P>

<P>When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube. </P>

<P>No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material. </P>

<P>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm. </P>

<H4>Mirror of Life Trapping </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Very Rare </P>

<P>When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. </P>

<P>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it. </P>

<P>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically. </P>

<P>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</P>

<P> If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. </P>

<P>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate. </P>

<P>In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it. </P>

<P>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. </P>

<P>Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. </P>

<P>Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, re-roll on the table if that card comes up again.) </P>

<P>Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.

<P>Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which </P>

<P>you are proficient appears on your person. The GM </P>

<P>chooses the weapon. </P>

<P>Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired. </P>

<P>Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times. </P>

<P>Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. </P>

<P>Rogue. An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you. </P>

<P>Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. </P>

<H4>Pipes of Haunting </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon </P>

<P>These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. </P>

<H4>Pipes of the Sewers </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t attack you unless you threaten or harm them. </P>

<P>The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. </P>

<P>Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. </P>

<H4>Portable Hole </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare </P>

<P>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the </P>

<P>dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. </P>

<P>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. </P>

<P>Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. </P>

<H4>Rod of Absorption </H4>

<P>Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell. </P>

<P>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored. </P>

<P>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot. </P>

<P>A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical. </P>

<H4>Rod of Alertness </H4>

<P>Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>This rod has the following properties. </P>

<P>Protective Aura. As a Magic action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any Invisible creature that is also in the Bright Light. </P>

<P>The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<H4>Rod of Lordly Might </H4>

<P>Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a </P>

<P>magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below. </P>

<P>Buttons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form: </P>

<P>Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end op</P>

<P>posite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed </P>

<P>Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for </P>

<P>an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as </P>

<P>a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) </P>

<P>that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. </P>

<P>Button 2. The rod’s flanged head folds down and </P>

<P>two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. </P>

<P>Button 3. The rod’s flanged head folds down, a </P>

<P>spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. </P>

<P>Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. </P>

<P>Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. </P>

<P>Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. </P>

<P>Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<P>Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<P>Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<H4>Rod of Rulership </H4>

<P>Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>You can take a Magic action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this way. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </P>

<Part>
<H4>Rod of Security </H4>

<P>Rod, Very Rare </P>

<P>While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist </P>

<P>only there. For example, a flower picked from a </P>

<P>garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane. </P>

<P>For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). </P>

<P>When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, this property can’t be used again until 10 days have passed. </P>

<H4>Rope of Climbing </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon </P>

<P>This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end of the rope to animate and move toward a destination you choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying. </P>

<P>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope. </P>

<P>The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every </P>
</Part>
<Part>
<H4>Rope of Entanglement </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Rare </P>

<P>This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space) or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand). </P>

<P>A target Restrained by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If you’re still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target’s space. </P>

<P>The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed. </P>

<H4>Scarab of Protection </H4>

<P>While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons. </P>

<P>Curse. This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you.

<H4>Slippers of Spider Climbing </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement) </P>

<P>While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

<P>inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces. </P>

<P>One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or Oil of Etherealness, or with a Wish spell. </P>

<H4>Spellguard Shield </H4>

<H4>Spell Scroll </H4>

<P>Scroll, Rarity Varies </P>

<P>A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost. </P>

<P>If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. </P>

<P>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table. </P>

<P>Spell Level Rarity Save DC Attack Bonus </P>

<P>Cantrip Common 13 +5 </P>

<P>1 Common 13 +5 </P>

<P>Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook. When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed. </P>

<H4>Sphere of Annihilation </H4>

<P>Wondrous Item, Legendary </P>

<P>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a </P>

<P>magical field surrounding it. </P>

<P>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage. </P>

<P>Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature’s control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line. </P>

<P>While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains. </P>

<P>Sphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the GM determines randomly what happens using the following table. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>1d100 Result </H5>

<P>01–50 The sphere is destroyed. </P>

<P>51–85 The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. </P>

<H2>Stat Block Overview </H2>

<P>A monster has a stat block that contains the rules necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts: </P>

<P>Name and General Details. The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along with any descriptive tags), and alignment. </P>

<P>Combat Highlights. Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, and Initiative are provided here. Ability Scores. A monster’s ability scores, ability </P>

<P>modifiers, and saving throws are listed here. </P>

<P>Other Details. The monster’s Senses, Languages, and CR entries appear here. Additional details ap</P>

<P>pear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies, </P>

<P>Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear. Traits. Monster characteristics that are active at all times or during certain situations appear here. Actions. The monster can take the actions here in addition to those in “Playing the Game.” Bonus Actions. This section provides a monster’s Bonus Actions, if any. Reactions and Legendary Actions. These sections provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Parts of a Stat Block </H2>

<P>The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glossary” and in this section. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Size </H3>

<P>A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you choose the creature’s size from those options. See “Playing the Game” for information on size. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Creature Type </H3>

<P>Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of </P>

<P>creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. </P>

<P>The game includes the following creature types, which have no rules of their own: </P>

<P>Aberrations are utterly alien beings, such as aboleths and cloakers. Beasts are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals. Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes. Constructs are magically created creatures such as homunculi and shield guardians. Dragons are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as red dragons and wyverns. </P>

<P>Elementals are beings from the Elemental Planes, such as efreet and water elementals. Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces of nature, such as dryads and goblins. Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower Planes, such as balors and hell hounds. Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes, </P>

<P>like fire giants and trolls. Humanoids are people defined by their roles and </P>

<P>professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. They include members of varied species. Monstrosities are unnatural creatures with strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears. Oozes are gelatinous creatures, including black puddings and gelatinous cubes. Plants are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters, such as shambling mounds and treants. Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such as ghosts, vampires, and zombies. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Descriptive Tags </H4>

<P>A monster might have one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide additional categorization and have no rules of their own, but certain game effects might refer to them. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Alignment </H3>

<P>The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is </P>

<P>a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster, inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, in particular, is an invitation for you to consider whether an individual leans toward one of the other alignments. </P>

<P>“Character Creation” describes the nine alignments and unaligned creatures. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Armor Class </H3>

<P>A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See “Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Initiative </H3>

<P>The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initiative modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you </P>

<P>roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s </P>

<P>Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that </P>

<P>number. </P>

<P>If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the Game.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Hit Points </H3>

<P>A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its Constitution. Either use the number for the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points randomly; don’t use both. </P>

<P>A monster’s size typically determines the die used to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. </P>

<P>Hit Dice by Size Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die </P>

<P>Tiny d4 2½ </P>

<P>Small d6 3½ </P>

<P>Medium d8 4½ </P>

<P>Large d10 5½ </P>

<P>Huge d12 6½ </P>

<P>Gargantuan d20 10½ </P>

<P>A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by </P>

<P>the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster </P>

<P>has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11). </P>

<P>For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Speed </H3>

<P>The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some </P>

<P>monsters have one or more of the following speeds: Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Ability Scores </H3>

<P>Every monster has six ability scores along with </P>

<P>corresponding ability score modifiers and saving throw modifiers. For more information on ability </P>

<P>scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Skills </H3>

<P>The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability </P>

<P>modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers </P>

<P>might apply. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Resistances and Vulnerabilities </H3>

<P>These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more information. </P>

<P>RUNNING A MONSTER </P>

<P>To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat: </P>

<P>Special Abilities. If the monster has a special ability that deals a lot of damage but has a limited number of uses, such as a recharging breath weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day, have it use that special ability as quickly and as often as possible. </P>

<P>Multiattack. If the monster has Multiattack, have it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities. </P>

<P>Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it uses them as often as it can. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Immunities </H3>

<P>This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If the monster has damage and condition Immunities, the damage types are listed before the conditions. See “Playing the Game” for details. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Gear </H3>

<P>Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If a monster has equipment that can be given away or </P>

<P>retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The monster’s stat block might include special flourishes that happen when the monster uses an item, and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equipment” for that item. When used by someone else, a retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat block. </P>

<P>The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a </P>

<P>monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that </P>

<P>wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry. </P>

<P>Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is considered to be supernatural or highly specialized, and it is unusable when the monster is defeated. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Ammunition and Ranged Attacks </H4>

<P>A monster that requires ammunition to make </P>

<P>ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Equipping a Monster with Other Items </H4>

<P>You may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the items in “Equipment” for </P>

<P>inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s </P>

<P>equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. </P>

<P>Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented magic items, since those might alter the monster’s Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic item, the monster can have Attunement with magic items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with a class tag after its creature type is considered a member of that class for Attunement purposes. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Senses </H3>

<P>The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive </P>

<P>Perception score, as well as any special senses the monster possesses. Passive Perception and special senses are described in “Rules Glossary.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Languages </H3>

<P>This entry lists languages that the monster can use to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t communicate with it, which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a creature doesn’t comprehend any language. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Telepathy </H4>

<P>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary”for more information. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Challenge Rating </H3>

<P>Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,” </P>

<P>while guidance on using CR to plan potential combat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.” </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Experience Points </H4>

<P>The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is awarded for defeating the monster in combat or otherwise neutralizing it. </P>

<P>Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Actions </H3>

<P>A monster can take the actions in this section or take one of the actions available to all creatures, as described in “Playing the Game.” </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Attack Notation </H4>

<P>The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether </P>

<P>the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. For details on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game” and “Spells.” </P>

<P>Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit:” notation. </P>

<P>Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information follows the “Miss:” notation. </P>

<P>Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs regardless of whether it hits or misses its target, that information follows the “Hit or Miss:” notation. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Saving Throw Effect Notation </H4>

<P>If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi</P>

<P>fies the kind of save required and then provides the </P>

<P>save’s DC, a description of which creatures make the save, and an explanation of what happens on a failed or successful save. </P>

<P>“Half damage only” on a successful save means the target takes half as much damage (round down) as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all other parts of the effect. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Damage Notation </H4>

<P>A stat block usually provides both a number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die expression in parentheses; don’t use both. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Multiattack </H4>

<P>Some creatures can make more than one attack when they take the Attack action. Such creatures have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a creature can make, as well as any additional abilities it can use, as part of the Attack action. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Spellcasting </H4>

<P>If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. </P>

<P>A monster’s spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisibility spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means the spell affects only the hag. </P>

<P>Spell Components. The Spellcasting trait notes whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster’s use of Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that requires Material components has them. </P>

<P>Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell-casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in just one action unless the action’s description states otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.” </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Bonus Action </H3>

<P>If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for details on Bonus Actions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Reactions </H3>

<P>If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed in this section along with their triggers. See “Playing the Game” for details on Reactions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Legendary Actions </H3>

<P>If the monster has Legendary Action options, those are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an action that a monster can take immediately after another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions can be taken at a time and only after another creature’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legendary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is otherwise unable to take actions. </P>

<P>The monster has a limited number of Legendary </P>

<P>Action uses, and that number is specified in the </P>

<P>stat block. The monster expends one use whenever it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Limited Usage </H3>

<P>Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. Here are the most common ways that usage is limited: </P>

<P>X/Day. This notation means the stat block part can be used a certain number of times (represented </P>

<P>by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest </P>

<P>to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be </P>

<P>taken once and that the monster must finish a </P>

<P>Long Rest to take it again. </P>

<P>Recharge X–Y. This notation means a monster can use the stat block part once. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll is within the number range given in the notation (represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use of that part, which also recharges when the mon</P>

<P>ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example, </P>

<P>“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can take the action once. Then, at the start of each of the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that action if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6. </P>

<P>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation means the monster can use the stat block </P>

<P>part once and must then finish a Short or Long </P>

<P>Rest to use it again. </P>

<P>Luring Song. The harpy sings a magical melody, which lasts until the harpy’s Concentration ends on it. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 11, each Humanoid and Giant in a 300-foot Emanation originating from the harpy when the song starts. Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until the song ends and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. While Charmed, the target has the Incapacitated condition and ignores the Luring Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the harpy. It doesn’t avoid Opportunity Attacks; however, before moving into damaging terrain (such as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target repeats the save. Success: The target is immune to this harpy’s Luring Song for 24 hours. </P>
